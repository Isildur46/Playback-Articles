# Introduction

# 导言

At a gathering of playback theatre companies in New Zealand in 1996 a Maori<sup>1</sup> woman told a story about members of her tribe being denied access to their traditional land as they protested during the official commemoration of Waitangi Day<sup>2</sup>. Each year a powerful police presence keeps all except the selected officials and guests from the grounds of their meetinghouse, where the official ceremony takes place.

1996 年，在新西兰一个一人一故事剧团的聚会上，一位毛利族妇女<sup>1</sup>讲述了这样一个故事：她的部落成员在怀唐伊日<sup>2</sup>正式纪念活动期间进行抗议，却被拒绝进入他们的传统土地。每年，除了选定的官员和来宾之外，强大的警力都会把所有其他人挡在举行正式仪式的会场之外。

In playback theatre, real stories are told by members of the audience and ‘played back’ in an immediate improvised performance. At this gathering the Maori woman told her story to an all-Pakeha<sup>3</sup> audience, and then she watched as it was re-enacted by an all-Pakeha cast. The atmosphere in the room during this process was alive and intense.

在一人一故事剧场中，观众讲述真实的故事，并在即兴表演中“回演”这个故事。在这次聚会上，这位毛利妇女向所有帕卡人<sup>3</sup>观众讲述了她的故事，然后她观看了由全帕卡人演员重新演绎的过程。在这一过程中，房间里的气氛活跃而紧张。

1 Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand, of Polynesian origin.

1 毛利人是新西兰的原住民，源于波利尼西亚。

2 Waitangi Day is a national holiday to mark the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, a historical document which Maori signed in good faith convinced that the intention was to protect their rights and sovereignty over Maori land. The failure to respect and honor this Treaty until quite recently has resulted in many grievances, divisions and inequities in New Zealand society.

2 怀唐伊日是纪念《怀唐伊条约》签署的全国性节日，毛利人在签署这份历史性文件时深信，条约的目的是保护他们对毛利人土地的权利和主权。直到最近，由于未能尊重和履行该条约，新西兰社会出现了许多不满、分裂和不平等现象。

3 Pakeha are New Zealanders of European origin.

3 帕卡人，异邦人、白人 Pakeha 是指欧洲血统的新西兰人。

While those present were familiar with stories about the Treaty of Waitangi from educational and news media sources, the actors and the musician re-enacted this story in a way that captured the centuries-old experience of grief, loss and separation. The teller was very satisfied with their rendition, and everyone in the room, audience and performers, was moved.

虽然在场的人都从教育和新闻媒体上熟悉了有关《威坦哲条约》的故事，但演员和乐师以一种捕捉到几个世纪以来悲伤、失落和分离经历的方式重新演绎了这个故事。讲述者对他们的演绎非常满意，在场的每个人，包括观众和演员，都被感动了。

Bev Hosking was one of the actors and had been chosen to take the role of ‘the land’. She reflects: “It was a profound experience being ‘the land’. I could begin to feel something of the scale of the loss and separation – the people couldn't get back to their land. I felt such strong grief. The telling and performing of that story allowed all of us who were involved to have a deep experience of the world of the teller, and a glimpse of Maori people's relationship to the land. A member of the audience came up to me later and said “This story is so familiar to me, but today I understood it for the first time. I really ‘got’ it.”

Bev Hosking 是演员之一，被选为“土地”的扮演者。她说扮演“土地”是一次深刻的体验。我开始能感受到损失和分离的程度--人们无法回到他们的土地上。我感到了强烈的悲痛。通过讲述和演绎这个故事，我们所有参与其中的人都对讲述者的世界有了深刻的体验，也对毛利人与土地的关系有了一瞥。一位观众后来走过来对我说：“这个故事对我来说太熟悉了，但今天我第一次理解了它。我真的‘懂了’”。

Currently in New Zealand typical responses to such grievances are guilt, powerlessness and despair, often accompanied by impatience, defensiveness or minimizing. This telling allowed for a new relationship to occur around these painful historical issues. In the intensity of the moment Bev noticed something significant had happened. “*There was a very receptive quality in the group as this story was told and performed. I felt we had gone somewhere new: that in this moment we had found a new meeting point.We did not move away from the pain of the situation. We all felt the sense of loss and we could all grieve this together. I was very excited.”*

目前，在新西兰，人们对这种不满的典型反应是内疚、无能为力和绝望，往往伴随着不耐烦、防卫或最小化。这次讲述让我们围绕这些痛苦的历史问题建立了一种新的关系。在这强烈的时刻，Bev 注意到发生了一些重要的事情。“在讲述和演绎这个故事的过程中，大家都非常乐于接受。我感觉我们到了一个新的地方：在这一刻，我们找到了一个新的交汇点。我们都感受到了失落感，我们可以一起为此悲伤。我非常激动”。

On reflection, the telling and re-enactment of this story was perhaps an example of what Bjorn Krondorfer (1995: 133) describes as “small moments of redemption, in which meaning emerges out of a sharing and listening to injurious memory”. It also illustrates Charles Villa Vicencio's (2001:1) idea that “reconciliation is the creation of time and space in which to find new ways of dealing with past grievances”. For Bev: “*It gave me an inkling of what might be possible with Playback Theatre.”*

反思一下，这个故事的讲述和重新演绎也许就是比约恩-克朗多佛（Bjorn Krondorfer）（1995:133）所描述的“救赎的小时刻，在这个时刻，意义从分享和倾听伤害性记忆中产生”。这也说明了查尔斯-维拉-维森西奥（2001:1）的观点，即“和解是创造时间和空间，在其中找到处理过去冤屈的新方法”。对于 Bev 来说：“它让我看到了一人一故事剧场的可能性”。

Since the experience described above, her discoveries as a teacher of playback theatre in many parts of the world have confirmed her initial hopes: that playback theatre can bring people together and offer a creative approach in fostering meaningful community dialogue. This paper examines playback theatre as a creative resource for community- building, particularly in situations where reconciliation is needed.

自上述经历以来，她作为一名教师在世界许多地方教授一人一故事剧场的发现证实了她最初的希望：一人一故事剧场可以将人们聚集在一起，为促进有意义的社区对话提供一种创造性的方法。本文将探讨一人一故事剧场作为社区建设的一种创造性资源，尤其是在需要和解的情况下。

## *What is Reconciliation?*

## *什么是和解？*

There are many communities and nations in the world where the relationships between neighbors and citizens have been severely damaged by war, ethnic violence, dispossession, oppression and discrimination. In many of these settings reconciliation is needed.

世界上有许多社区和国家，邻居和公民之间的关系因战争、种族暴力、剥夺财产、压迫和歧视而受到严重破坏。在许多这样的环境中，都需要和解。

Hizkias Assefa (1993:9) defines reconciliation as “the restoration of broken relationships or the coming together of those who have been alienated and separated from one another by conflict, to create a community again.”

Hizkias Assefa（1993:9）将和解定义为“恢复破裂的关系，或将那些因冲突而彼此疏远和分离的人聚集在一起，重新创建一个社区”。

He observes (Assefa, 2004 Brandeis Institute) that the process of reconciliation is not always possible or appropriate. For example, when one or both parties are unwilling to reconcile or when one party is unwilling to give up a major power imbalance to become equal partners in social and political repair.

他认为（Assefa，2004 年，布兰代斯研究所），和解进程并非总是可行或适当的。例如，一方或双方不愿意和解，或者一方不愿意放弃重大的权力失衡，成为社会和政治修复的平等伙伴。

Reconciliation can be slow and complex. As Villa-Vicencio (2001: 6) comments, it “is not a sudden act of moral insight. It is a process of learning. It is the beginning of a new way of living. It involves different attitudes towards, and relationships with, those from whom one often continues to be estranged. It is a relationship that places dialogue and reciprocity at the center of the struggle to be fully human, suggesting that people are incomplete to the extent that they are alienated from one another.”

和解可能是缓慢而复杂的。正如 Villa-Vicencio（2001: 6）所评论的，和解“不是一种突然的道德洞察行为。它是一个学习的过程。它是一种新生活方式的开始。它涉及到对那些经常与自己疏远的人的不同态度以及与他们的关系。这是一种将对话和互惠置于争取成为完整的人的斗争中心的关系，表明人与人之间的疏远是不完整的”。

Charles Villa-Vicencio (2001:2) warns against having a tight definition of reconciliation and reducing the process of reconciliation to a neat set of rules. He comments: “There are no simple ‘how to’ steps involved. It includes serendipity, imagination, risk and the exploration of what is means to ‘start again’. It involves grace. It is a celebration of the human spirit. It is about making what seems impossible possible. It is about the complex business of real people engaging one another in the quest for life. It is an art rather than a science.”

Charles Villa-Vicencio（2001:2）警告说，不要给和解下一个严格的定义，也不要把和 解过程简化为一套整齐划一的规则。他评论说，“没有简单的‘如何’步骤。它包括偶然性、想象力、风险和对‘重新开始’含义的探索。它包括优雅。它是对人类精神的赞美。它将看似不可能的事情变为可能。它是关于真实的人们在追求生活的过程中相互接触的复杂事务。它是一门艺术，而不是科学”。

Adopting a similarly explorative and open-ended definition of reconciliation, Cynthia Cohen (2004) describes the processes and tasks that reconciliation can involve. She describes “a set of deep processes designed to transform relationships of hatred and mistrust into relationships of trust and trustworthiness. These processes involve former enemies acknowledging each other's humanity, empathizing with each other's suffering, addressing and redressing past injustice and sometimes expressing remorse, granting forgiveness and offering reparations. Reconciliation reflects a shift in attention away from blaming the other to taking responsibility for the attitudes and actions of one's self and one's own community” (Cohen, 2004: 6).

辛西娅-科恩（Cynthia Cohen，2004）对和解的定义同样具有探索性和开放性，她 描述了和解可能涉及的过程和任务。她描述了“一系列旨在将仇恨和不信任关系转变为信任和可靠关系的深层过程。在这些过程中，昔日的敌人要承认彼此的人性，对彼此的痛苦感同身受，解决和纠正过去的不公正，有时还要表达悔恨，给予宽恕和赔偿。和解反映了一种注意力的转移，即从指责对方转向对自己和自己社区的态度和行为负责”（Cohen，2004 年：6）。

She suggests that reconciliation involves engagement in at least some of the following tasks, not necessarily taken in this order:

她建议，和解至少涉及以下一些任务，但不一定按此顺序进行：

1. Appreciating each other's humanity and respecting each other's culture; 
欣赏彼此的人性，尊重彼此的文化；

2. Telling and listening to each other's stories and developing more complex narratives and more nuanced understandings of identity; 讲述和倾听彼此的故事，发展更复杂的叙事和更细致入微的身份理解；

3. Acknowledging harms, telling truths and mourning losses; 承认伤害，说出真相，悼念损失；

4. Empathizing with each other's suffering; 对彼此的痛苦感同身受；

5. Acknowledging and redressing injustices; 承认并纠正不公正现象；

6. Expressing remorse, repenting, apologizing; letting go of bitterness, forgiving; 表示悔恨、忏悔、道歉；放下怨恨、宽恕；

7. Imagining and substantiating a new future; including agreements about how future conflicts will be engaged constructively (Cohen, 2004: 6). 想象并证实新的未来，包括就如何建设性地参与未来冲突达成一致（Cohen，2004: 6）。

This paper illustrates how playback theatre can contribute as people from divided communities engage in a number of these reconciliation processes and tasks.

本文阐述了当来自分裂社区的人们参与其中的一些和解进程和任务时，一人一故事剧场可如何做出贡献。

## *What is Playback Theatre?*

## *什么是 Playback Theatre？*

As illustrated in the story above, playback theatre is a spontaneous improvised theatre involving a unique collaboration between performers and audience. A playback theatre troupe usually comprises several actors and one or two musicians. In addition, the performance is led and facilitated by a conductor who interacts with the audience, encouraging them to tell stories from their everyday lives. Someone from the audience tells a story from their life, chooses actors to play the different roles, and then watches as their story is immediately recreated and given artistic shape and coherence.

如上故事所示，一人一故事剧场是一种自发的即兴戏剧，涉及演员与观众之间的独特合作。一人一故事剧团通常由几名演员和一到两名乐师组成。此外，演出还由一名领航员来引导和带领，领航员会与观众互动，鼓励他们讲述日常生活中的故事。观众讲述自己生活中的故事，选择演员扮演不同的角色，然后看着自己的故事被立即再现，并被赋予艺术的形式和连贯性。

Jonathan Fox<sup>4</sup> originated playback theatre and developed it with a group of performers that included his partner, Jo Salas<sup>5</sup>. Their first playback theatre performance took place in New York in 1975. The genesis of playback theatre, its structure and operating values are described by Salas (1993), Fox (1994) and Fox and Dauber (eds.) (1999).

乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathan Fox）<sup>4</sup>发明了一人一故事剧场，并与包括他的搭档乔-萨拉斯（Jo Salas）<sup>5</sup>在内的一群演员共同发展了一人一故事剧场。他们的第一场一人一故事剧场演出于 1975 年在纽约举行。Salas (1993)、Fox (1994) 和 Fox and Dauber (eds.)(1999)对一人一故事剧场的起源、结构和运作价值进行了描述。

In 1980 Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas ran training workshops in Australia and New Zealand, stimulating the development of playback theatre companies in both countries. Today there are playback theatre companies in more than 30 countries of the world. Training is offered in situ to these groups by a number of experienced travelling teachers. In addition longer residential training courses are conducted in a number of locations including the USA and in New Zealand. Since 1990 playback theatre practitioners have built their links at international conferences organized by the International Playback Theatre Network (IPTN) and by contributing to IPTN newsletters.

1980 年，乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathan Fox）和乔-萨拉斯（Jo Salas）在澳大利亚和新西兰举办了培训工作坊，促进了两国一人一故事剧团的发展。如今，世界上 30 多个国家都有一人一故事剧团。一些经验丰富的巡回教师为这些团体提供现场培训。此外，还在包括美国和新西兰在内的许多地方举办了时间较长的寄宿培训课程。自 1990 年以来，一人一故事剧场实践者在国际一人一故事剧场网络（IPTN）组织的国际会议上建立了联系，并向 IPTN 简报投稿。

# What Playback Theatre Can Contribute to Reconciliation

# 一人一故事剧场对和解的贡献

## *Opening up a Creative Communal Space*

## *开辟创意社区空间*

A performance of playback theatre opens up a creative communal space larger than the family where neighbors and citizens can explore common concerns as a group or community. This is a significant space for the work of reconciliation. Jean Paul Lederach (1997:30) describes this work as creating a place of encounter, in which parties to a conflict can meet, focus on their relationship and share their perceptions, feelings, and experiences with one another, with the goal of creating new perceptions and a new shared experience.

一人一故事剧场的演出开辟了一个比家庭更大的创造性公共空间，在这里，邻居和市民可以作为一个群体或社区探讨共同关心的问题。这是和解工作的重要空间。Jean Paul Lederach（1997:30）将这一工作描述为创造一个相遇的场所，冲突各方可以在此相遇，关注他们之间的关系，分享彼此的看法、感受和经历，目的是创造新的看法和新的共同经历。

For while playback theatre is entertaining and dramatically pleasing it is not just an entertainment experience or a social pastime. In contrast to conventional theatre the audience members engage with the conductor and the performing troupe and with other members of the audience as they tell stories from their everyday lives. It has the effect sought by Njabulo Ndebele (cited by Gobodo-Madikizela, 2004) who noted the value of making public spaces intimate in order to bring about a change in social relationships. Some of the stories told in playback theatre are brief snapshots of moments and others are longer more complex tales. Some are light, fleeting, and funny, and others are serious, difficult and painful. Playback theatre aims for a different and deeper level of engagement than other social or entertainment settings.

虽然一人一故事剧场具有娱乐性和戏剧性，但它并不仅仅是一种娱乐体验或社交消遣。与传统戏剧不同的是，在讲述日常生活中的故事时，观众会与领航员、演员团队以及其他观众互动。它具有 Njabulo Ndebele（转引自 Gobodo-Madikizela，2004）所追求的效果，他指出了让公共空间变得亲切以改变社会关系的价值。一人一故事剧场中讲述的故事有些是简短的瞬间剪影，有些则是篇幅较长的复杂故事。有些故事轻松、短暂、有趣，有些则严肃、艰难、痛苦。与其他社交或娱乐场合相比，一人一故事剧场的目标是让观众参与到不同的、更深层次的活动中来。

The structure of the playback theatre form helps make the development of a communal space possible. At each performance members of the audience ‘warm up’ to the storytelling process by telling about fragments of their recent experience (“What was it like getting here today? What is one word to describe your week?”). These are played back to them immediately in brief, often energetic, but contained theatrical pieces called fluid sculptures which last no more than a minute. Little is demanded of the people who tell these moments.

一人一故事剧场形式的结构有助于发展公共空间。在每场演出中，观众通过讲述他们最近的经历片段（“今天到这里是什么感觉？用什么词来形容你这一周的生活？”）这些片段会立即以简短、充满活力但又不失内涵的戏剧形式回演给观众，这些戏剧片段被称为“流动塑像”，持续时间不超过一分钟。对讲述这些片段的人要求不高。

Later in the performance once a sense of connection and an ease in telling are established, the conductor invites individuals to come forward to sit with her/him to tell a story from their lives. The story is told in response to specific questions from the conductor which help contain and shape the telling and assist the performers to take up the roles they are given. As the story is told, the teller is invited to choose which performer will take the part of the teller in the story and which actors will take the other significant roles. As audiences get to know these conventions, the playback theatre form becomes familiar territory, contributing to a sense of psychological safety. Telling these stories is voluntary for the audience. Nevertheless telling requires a willingness and sometimes courage to ‘put oneself on the map’ and to brave the unpredictability of how your story will come out and how it will be ‘played back’ by the performers.

在演出的后期，一旦建立了联系感和讲述的轻松感，领航员就会邀请个人上前与她/他坐在一起，讲述他们生活中的一个故事。在讲述故事时，要回答领航员提出的具体问题，这些问题有助于控制和塑造讲述过程，并帮助演员扮演好自己的角色。在讲述故事的过程中，讲述者会被邀请选择哪位演员来扮演故事中的讲述者，哪位演员来扮演其他重要角色。当观众了解了这些惯例之后，一人一故事剧场的形式就会成为他们熟悉的领域，从而产生一种心理安全感。讲述这些故事对观众来说是自愿的。然而，讲故事需要一种意愿，有时甚至是勇气，即“把自己放在地图上”，勇敢地面对你的故事将如何呈现以及演员将如何“回演”的不可预测性。

The quality of the communal space generated by a playback theatre event can be viewed as something produced as part of a ritual process. A number of writers have built on the work of Victor Turner (1969, 1982) to describe the importance of ritual in reconciliation processes. Bjorn Krondorfer (1997) highlights communal intimacy called ‘communitas’ which emerges in rituals processes. Participants put a high value on personal honesty, openness and lack of pretension and recognize the value of relating directly to others just as they present themselves in the here and now. Lisa Schirch (2001) sees rituals “holding together ambiguities, complexities, and paradoxes in a way rational, logical thought cannot.” Jonathan Fox (1999) and Diane Adderley (2004) write of the importance of the ritual element in playback theatre in creating conditions for the telling of stories in community settings.

一人一故事剧场活动所产生的公共空间的质量可被视为仪式过程的一部分。许多作家以维克多-特纳（Victor Turner，1969，1982）的著作为基础，描述了仪式在和解过程中的重要性。比约恩-克朗多佛（Bjorn Krondorfer，1997）强调了在仪式过程中出现的被称为“共通性”的社区亲密关系。参与者非常重视个人的诚实、开放和不矫揉造作，并认识到直接与他人建立联系的价值，就像他们在此时此地展示自己一样。丽莎-希尔奇（Lisa Schirch，2001）认为，仪式“以理性逻辑思维无法做到的方式，将模糊性、复杂性和矛盾性结合在一起”。乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathan Fox，1999）和戴安娜-阿德雷（Diane Adderley，2004）写道，一人一故事剧场中的仪式元素在为社区环境中讲述故事创造条件方面具有重要意义。

The development of such a communal space was the subject of comment by a number of participants at the 2004 New Zealand Summer School. The space generated was unpressured, allowed for silence and offered a change in rhythm and a different sense of time to participants‟ everyday lives. These factors had a powerful effect, enabling people to bring forward their deeper stories.

2004 年新西兰暑期学校的一些学员对这种公共空间的开发发表了意见。所创造的空间没有压力，可以保持安静，为参与者的日常生活提供了节奏上的变化和不同的时间感。这些因素产生了强大的影响，使人们能够提出自己更深层次的故事。

## *Building Community Relationships*

## 建立社区关系

The communal space generated in a playback theatre performance creates the context for building community relationships.

一人一故事剧场演出所产生的公共空间为建立社区关系创造了环境。

Reconciliation involves restoring and renewing relationships that have been characterized by hate and mistrust. The parties involved can feel trapped in a destructive and unsustainable dynamic. The aim of reconciliation is to transcend this impasse and involve former enemies and adversaries in new ways of engaging (Villa-Vicencio:2).

和解涉及到恢复和更新以仇恨和不信任为特征的关系。有关各方可能会感到自己陷入了一种破坏性的、不可持续的态势之中。和解的目的是超越这种僵局，让曾经的敌人和对手以新的方式参与进来（Villa-Vicencio:2）。

Playback theatre can contribute to reconciliation by building community relationships as people tell, listen to and witness each other's stories and see these stories performed. In good playback theatre an open group culture is developed in which audience members feel interested and motivated to tell stories, and feel their stories are listened to respectfully and in an accepting way by the conductor, the performers and by fellow audience members. Playback practitioners develop strong listening and empathic skills which are used in their performing work and modeled in their interactions with tellers and the wider audience.

当人们讲述、聆听和见证彼此的故事并观看这些故事的演出时，一人一故事剧场可以建立社区关系，从而促进和解。在优秀的一人一故事剧场中，会形成一种开放的群体文化，观众会感到有兴趣和动力去讲述故事，并感到他们的故事得到了领航员、演员和其他观众的尊重和倾听。一人一故事剧场演员培养了很强的倾听和同理心，这些技能在他们的剧场演出工作中得到了运用，并在他们与讲述者和广大观众的互动中得到了示范。

A playback theatre performance is often effective in evoking stories from different subgroups of a community. To date we know of several examples of playback being used directly for reconciliation with both factions of a divided community together at a playback performance.<sup>8</sup> These will be described more fully as this working paper is developed. Among the playback theatre work researched in detail for this paper are performances with groups on one side of a conflict and training and performances involving a mix of individual performers from the different groups of a divided community. This work illustrates significant achievements in re-building community relationships for those who have suffered violence and oppression and in processing these traumatic events.

一人一故事剧场的演出通常能有效地唤起社区不同小群体的故事。迄今为止，我们知道有几个直接利用一人一故事剧场促进和解的例子，在一人一故事剧场演出中，分裂社区的两派都在一起<sup>8</sup>。在本文详细研究的一人一故事剧场作品中，有冲突一方团体的演出，也有来自分裂社区不同团体的个人演员参与的培训和演出。这些工作表明，在为遭受暴力和压迫的人重建社区关系以及处理这些创伤事件方面取得了重大成就。

8 This includes playback theatre training conducted by Jonathan Fox in Burundi with mixed Hutu and Tutsi audiences (see Fox 2003). Separate performances for white people and people of color culminating in a joint performance for 250 people were run by Playback for Change in the United States (see Cohen, 2004). Other examples include Jewish/Muslim dialogue groups in New York, Hudson Valley and Toronto that have engaged playback theatre companies to perform. Playback theatre is also being used in relation to Middle East conflict and to improve German/Jewish relations. These warrant further exploration as this working paper is developed.

8 这包括乔纳森-福克斯在布隆迪为胡图族和图西族混合观众进行的一人一故事剧场培训（见福克斯，2003）。在美国，“一人一故事剧场促进变革”组织为白人和有色人种分别演出，最后由 250 人共同演出（见 Cohen, 2004）。其他例子还包括纽约、哈德逊河谷和多伦多的犹太/穆斯林对话团体，他们聘请了一人一故事剧团进行演出。一人一故事剧场也被用于中东冲突和改善德国与犹太人的关系。随着本工作文件的编写，这些问题值得进一步探讨。

## *Creating a Safe Space for Feeling and Reflection*

## *为感受和反思创造安全空间*

Playback theatre is often performed in community meeting places and has a less formal ‘stage’ than traditional theatre. However, there is a clear separation and delineation of the performing space and the audience, and a particular recognizable spatial configuration for the conductor, musician and actors and the teller as they come to the stage to tell their story.

一人一故事剧场通常在社区集会场所演出，与传统戏剧相比，它的“舞台”没有那么正式。不过，演出空间和观众席之间有明显的分隔和界限，领航员、乐师、演员和讲述者上台讲述故事时也有特定的可识别空间配置。

The open, uncluttered stage is a projective space full of possibility. This encourages a flow of imagination, thoughts and memories in both audience members and performers, expanding their imaginative capacities. The spatial boundaries described above assist in the reduction of anxiety and support the development of spontaneity, creativity and courage.

开放、整洁的舞台是一个充满可能性的投射空间。这鼓励了观众和演员的想象力、思想和记忆的流动，拓展了他们的想象能力。上述空间界限有助于减少焦虑，支持自发性、创造性和勇气的发展。

There is a recognizable structure and shape to a playback theatre performance. For example there is a familiar movement from short enactments to longer ones. There is a repeated cycle of activity incorporating an invitation to tell, the telling of a story, a transition to the enactment signaled by the phrase “let's watch”, the enactment and then an acknowledgment of the teller.

一人一故事剧场演出有其可识别的结构和形式。例如，从简短的形式到较长的形式是一个熟悉的过程。活动循环往复，包括邀请讲述、讲述故事、以“请看”为信号过渡到演绎，然后是对讲述者的致意。

These structures of the stage and the performance, and the theatrical enactment of the story itself, contribute to the creation of aesthetic distance, which enables both feelings and reflections to be present at the same time. As Scheff (2001: 57) comments: “At aesthetic distance, the members of the audience become emotionally involved in the drama, but not to the point where they forget that they are also observers. Aesthetic distance may be defined as the simultaneous and equal experience of being both participant and observer.”

舞台和演出的这些结构，以及戏剧故事本身的演绎，都有助于创造审美距离，使情感和思考同时存在。正如 Scheff (2001: 57) 所评论的那样：“在审美距离中，观众在情感上参与到戏剧中，但不会忘记自己也是观察者。审美距离可以定义为同时作为参与者和观察者的平等体验”。

Playback theatre as a form creates a space for tellers and audience members to feel and also reflect on their experiences. This is an important asset in working with the painful and difficult events encountered in situations where reconciliation is needed.

一人一故事剧场这种形式为讲述者和观众创造了一个感受和反思自身经历的空间。这是在需要和解的情况下处理痛苦和困难事件的重要基础。

## *Telling Personal Stories*

## *讲述个人故事*

Playback theatre builds relationship through the process of telling, listening to and performing personal stories. When an audience member moves to tell a story it is a gesture of intimacy. The teller is inviting others into their world in an act of generosity, which in a suitable group climate, is likely to call forth generosity in the listeners.

一人一故事剧场通过讲述、聆听和演绎个人故事的过程建立关系。当观众开始讲述故事时，这是一种亲密的姿态。讲述者以一种慷慨的行为邀请他人进入自己的世界，在适当的团体氛围中，这种行为很可能会唤起听众的慷慨之心。

Telling a story in playback theatre is, to some extent, a process of co-creation. The conductor's role is to accompany the teller, assist in shaping the story and, in a spirit of inquiry, to open out some of its aspects. At different points in the telling, the conductor will ask questions such as: ‘what is a word to describe your neighbor?’‘How did the shopkeeper respond?’‘What were you thinking at this time?’ so that the actors and the audience have a good enough understanding of the story. This inquiry has the effect of inviting reflection, of moving between different perspectives and building the complexity of the narrative. For playback theatre seeks to reflect the complexity of life rather than to simplify it.

在一人一故事剧场中讲述故事在某种程度上是一个共同创作的过程。领航员的作用是陪伴讲述者，协助塑造故事，并以探究的精神打开故事的某些方面。在讲述的不同阶段，领航员会提出一些问题，例如“用什么词来形容你的邻居？店主是如何回应的？”“此时你在想什么？”从而让演员和观众对故事有足够的了解。这种探究具有引人反思、在不同视角之间穿梭、构建叙事复杂性的效果。一人一故事剧场旨在反映生活的复杂性，而不是将其简单化。

In communities or groups alienated from each other the discourse about their situation can be simplified, repetitive and unproductive. Weingarten (2003: 234) notes that “stories that maintain binary oppositions of us versus them, or good versus evil, are insufficiently complex, or accurate, to assist people in revisioning their relationships.”

在相互疏远的社区或群体中，关于其处境的讨论可能会被简化、重复和无益。Weingarten（2003: 234）指出，“维持我们与他们或善与恶的二元对立的故事不够复杂或准确，无法帮助人们修正他们之间的关系”。

In contrast, the storytelling in playback theatre is layered and has many dimensions. Multiple images, threads and themes are presented and those listening are free to find their own meaning and their own relationship with what is told. The relationship of the teller to their story is evident: we are not just relating to the story, but to the teller and the teller's relationship with their story.

相比之下，一人一故事剧场中的故事则是多层次、多维度的。剧中呈现了多种形象、线索和主题，聆听者可以自由地寻找自己的意义，以及自己与所讲述内容之间的关系。讲述者与故事之间的关系显而易见：我们不仅与故事有关，还与讲述者以及讲述者与故事之间的关系有关。

Personal stories evoke feelings and stimulate the imagination. In the process of telling, both reflection and irony “increase narrative imagination, complicate interpretive frames and multiply speaker and listener roles.” (Cobb, 2003:299) The enactment also enables multiple perspectives to be portrayed, as Brook (1987:15) comments: “Theatre has the potential- unknown in other art forms- of replacing a single viewpoint by a multitude of different visions.”

个人故事唤起情感，激发想象。在讲述的过程中，反思和讽刺都“增加了叙事想象力，使解释框架复杂化，并使讲述者和倾听者的角色多重化”（Cobb, 2003:299）。正如布鲁克（Brook，1987:15）所评论的那样，戏剧的演绎也使多角度的描绘成为可能：“戏剧具有其他艺术形式所不具备的潜力，可以用多种不同的视角取代单一的观点”。

This complexity was the focus of one participant's reflection after the New Zealand Playback Theatre Summer School in 2004. She wrote: “The framework that the personal story provides is such an illuminating one. In particular, the structure of a playback story seems naturally to draw forth the complexities and contradictions within an event or an issue, even more so when we begin to listen to the story with an ear for those complexities. The ‘answer’ becomes far less important than the question, or more specifically, the questioning.”

这种复杂性是一位学员在 2004 年新西兰一人一故事剧场暑期班之后进行反思的重点。她写道：“个人故事提供的框架极具启发性。特别是，一人一故事剧场的故事结构似乎能自然而然地引出事件或问题中的复杂性和矛盾，当我们开始倾听故事时，这些复杂性就会更加明显。答案“远不如问题，或者更确切地说，提问来得重要”。

Teresa von Sommaruga Howard (2003:9) reflects on her work in conducting dialogue in large groups: “I have learnt that it is only when each person speaks from their own unique experience that something shifts”.

Teresa von Sommaruga Howard（2003:9）回顾了她在大型团体中开展对话的工作：“我认识到，只有当每个人都从自己的独特经历出发发言时，才会有所改变”。

Reflecting on a similar dynamic in playback theatre training and events, Bev Hosking comments: “In my work I have had numerous experiences where a shift from telling a grievance or injustice to telling a personal story has resulted in a noticeable increase in receptivity and creative responsiveness.”

贝芙-霍斯金（Bev Hosking）在回顾一人一故事剧场培训和活动中的类似动态时评论道：“在我的工作中，我曾有过无数次这样的经历：从讲述不满或不公正转变为讲述个人故事，从而明显提高了接受能力和创造性反应能力”。

## *Processing Difficult Events*

## *处理困难事件*

People experiencing trauma can become disconnected from themselves and isolated from others. Rebuilding emotional connections with oneself and one's immediate community can be an important part of the social healing required for reconciliation. This is illustrated in the following description of a playback theatre training workshop in Angola<sup>9</sup> which took place shortly after killings and kidnappings associated with the civil war at Caxito.

经历创伤的人可能会变得与自己脱节，与他人隔绝。重建与自己和周围社区的情感联系是和解所需的社会愈合的重要部分。下面例子的安哥拉一人一故事剧场培训工作坊<sup>9</sup>就说明了这一点，该工作坊是在与卡西托内战有关的杀戮和绑架事件发生后不久举办的。

9 Bev Hosking ran playback theatre training in Angola in May 2001. This involved a five day training workshop followed by two days of performances in the internally displaced persons camps.

9 贝芙-霍斯金 2001 年 5 月在安哥拉举办了一人一故事剧场培训工作坊。在为期五天的培训工作坊之后，又在境内流离失所者营地进行了两天的演出。

Early in the workshop participants‟ different responses to these events were explored using fluid sculptures. A range of feelings was expressed and diverse perspectives revealed, which generated interest and a feeling of support in the group.

工作坊一开始，与会者就利用流动塑像探讨了对这些事件的不同反应。与会者表达了各种感受，并揭示了不同的观点，这引起了小组成员的兴趣和支持感。

This was particularly significant for one of the participants whose mother had been living in Caxito. Until this time he had not realized the seriousness of what had happened. On the fourth day of the workshop he told a story of having lost contact with her after the events there. He had been deeply concerned for her safety and was very relieved when she arrived at his place in the middle of the previous night, having walked the 50 kilometers to Luanda.

这对一位母亲一直住在卡西托的参与者来说意义尤其重大。直到此时，他才意识到事情的严重性。在工作坊的第四天，他讲述了在那里发生的事件之后与母亲失去联系的故事。他一直非常担心她的安全，当她在前一天半夜步行 50 公里来到罗安达时，他才松了一口气。

During these few days he had kept his worry to himself. The opportunity to tell his story and have it witnessed by his community of fellow actors, allowed him to begin to let himself feel both his fear and his relief about what had been happening.

在这几天里，他一直对自己的担忧讳莫如深。有机会讲述他的故事，并让他的演员朋友们见证他的故事，让他开始让自己对所发生的一切感到恐惧和欣慰。

The following example from India<sup>10</sup> further illustrates how playback theatre can assist people to come out of isolation:

下面这个来自印度的例子<sup>10</sup>进一步说明了一人一故事剧场如何帮助人们走出孤独：

10 Bev Hosking and Mary Good have conducted playback theatre training in India with social action theatre practitioners during 6 out of 7 years between 1998-2004.

10 贝芙-霍斯金和玛丽-古德在 1998 年至 2004 年的 7 年中，有 6 年在印度与社会行动剧场实践者一起开展了一人一故事剧场培训。

A playback group in India was invited to do performances in two border villages for the victims of police torture. The invitation came from a non-government organization (NGO) worried about the deep loss of morale amongst the villagers. The police had been torturing many people in these villages over a period of time in attempts to get information about the whereabouts of a well-known smuggler.

印度的一个一人一故事团体应邀到两个边境村庄为警察酷刑的受害者演出。邀请方是一个非政府组织（NGO），该组织担心村民们士气低落。在过去的一段时间里，警察在这两个村子里对许多人施以酷刑，试图获取有关一名著名走私犯下落的信息。

In the performance, a man came to the teller's chair and began to tell his story. As he began to tell, he started weeping. He wept for some time and everyone in the audience also wept. It was an intense situation which made the conductor unsure whether they could continue the performance. The man told about his experience of being tortured by the police for no apparent reason as he did not have any relevant information. This was his story, but to some extent it was the story of everyone in the village. All of them had either been tortured themselves or were close to someone who had been. The story was extremely painful, the actors were very moved, and yet they managed to portray the story very sensitively.

在演出中，一个人走到讲述者的椅子前，开始讲述他的故事。讲着讲着，他开始流泪。他哭了一段时间，观众席上的每个人也都哭了。当时的情况非常紧张，领航员都不知道是否还能继续演出。这名男子讲述了他被警察无故折磨的经历，因为他没有任何相关信息。这是他的故事，但在某种程度上，这也是村里所有人的故事。他们所有人要么自己遭受过酷刑，要么身边有人遭受过酷刑。这个故事非常痛苦，演员们非常感动，但他们还是非常敏感地描述了这个故事。

The man had kept his head bowed throughout the telling of his story. There was a silence at the end of the enactment and slowly the man lifted his head. He looked up and out and said *“I think that now we have wept enough. Now I feel we can go forward and now for the first time I can begin to think about the education of my grandson”.*

在讲述故事的整个过程中，这名男子一直低着头。故事结束时，一片寂静，那人慢慢地抬起了头。他抬头向外看了看，说：“我想，现在我们已经哭够了。现在我觉得我们可以继续前进了，现在我第一次可以开始考虑我孙子的教育问题了”。

There was a strongly positive response to the performance. The audience felt understood, respected and affirmed in their ability to have withstood extremely cruel situations and to hold on to some hope. They realized that they were no longer alone in their struggle.

演出获得了强烈的积极反响。观众感受到了理解、尊重和肯定，因为他们经受住了极端残酷的环境，并坚持了一些希望。他们意识到，自己不再是孤军奋战。

## *Witnessing*

## *见证*

In playback theatre participants are invited to be present to their own experience and to the experiences of others in an open, non-judgmental manner. This process of witnessing is described by Felman and Laub (1992:70) as “a social process that rests on careful attention, ‘listening’.” This quality of listening creates a space that allows for a teller to be present to their own story and move further towards understanding and integrating their experience.

在一人一故事剧场中，参与者被邀请以开放、非评判性的方式呈现自己和他人的经历。Felman 和 Laub (1992:70)将这种见证过程描述为“一种依赖于仔细观察的社会过程，‘倾听’”。这种“倾听”的品质创造了一个空间，让讲述者能够亲身经历自己的故事，并进一步理解和整合自己的经历。

Weingarten (2003: 232) comments: “It has been my experience that compassionate witnessing first invites a telling of the story that allows people to express the states of vulnerability. This story is often one that has been silenced, blocked, denied or forbidden. As difficult as it is to put this story into words- and as painful as it is to feel the states of vulnerability – it is also the beginning of an antidote to the violence that inspired it.”

Weingarten (2003: 232) 评论道：“我的经验是，富有同情心的见证首先需要讲述故事，让人们表达脆弱的状态。这个故事往往是一个被压制、封锁、否认或禁止的故事。尽管将这个故事用语言表达出来很困难，尽管感受脆弱状态很痛苦，但这也是对激发它的暴力进行解毒的开始”。

Occasionally audience members respond to a story with problem solving and advice giving, neither of which is helpful. Modeling of alternative responses by the conductor and the actors helps to reduce this tendency. At times the playback conductor may have to work hard to counter a culture of problem solving which can arise in situations where people feel urgent about achieving immediate change.

有时，观众会以解决问题和提出建议的方式来回应故事，但这两种方式都无济于事。领航员和演员示范其他回应方式有助于减少这种倾向。有时，在人们迫切希望立即实现变革的情况下，一人一故事领航员可能不得不努力抵制解决问题的文化。

Witnessing occurs in the telling and listening to a story and in another form as the story is enacted. The use of movement, sound, music, dialogue and image can provide a powerful acknowledgement to the teller of the different dimensions of their story, as does the willingness and commitment of the performers to imagine and portray the teller's world.

见证发生在讲述和聆听故事的过程中，也发生在故事演绎的另一种形式中。动作、声音、音乐、对话和图像的使用，以及演员对想象和描绘讲述者的世界的意愿和承诺，都能让讲述者对其故事的不同层面产生强烈的认同感。

At times a story can become skewed when the performers‟ strong ideology blocks their capacity to listen. These skews, both subtle and obvious, can occur in any group or culture. They arise more often when a strong ideology is present and where the desire to teach comes to the fore. For this reason, playback practitioners must get to know their own values and biases and how these affect their capacity to listen. One of the biggest challenges of this work is to suspend judgment and witnessing requires it.

有时，当演员强烈的意识形态阻碍了他们倾听的能力时，故事就会出现偏差。这些微妙或明显的偏差可能发生在任何群体或文化中。当强烈的意识形态和教化的欲望占据上风时，这些偏差就会更频繁地出现。因此，一人一故事剧场实践者必须了解自己的价值观和偏见，以及这些是如何影响他们的倾听能力的。这项工作的最大挑战之一是暂停评判，而见证，恰恰需要暂停评判。

The collective witnessing of a story by a community builds connections between the teller and members of the audience, as well as between the audience members themselves. It has the effect of strengthening the teller's relationship with the others present, and serves as a pathway to integrating or at times re-integrating an individual into their community.

社区对故事的集体见证在讲述者和听众之间以及听众本身之间建立了联系。它可以加强讲述者与在场其他人的关系，也是个人融入或有时重新融入社区的途径。

This happens during a playback theatre event itself, and is very often built on in the time following the event when members of the audience may approach a teller. During this interaction they might affirm the teller's courage in telling, share their responses, recount similar stories, or describe new insights into their own experiences as a result of listening to the teller's story.

这种情况发生在一人一故事剧场活动期间，通常在活动结束后，观众可能会走近讲述者。在这种互动中，他们可能会肯定讲述者讲述故事的勇气，分享他们的反应，讲述类似的故事，或描述他们在聆听讲述者的故事后对自身经历的新认识。

Witnessing contributes to social repair relevant to any community's daily life as well as to processes of reconciliation when both the personal and social worlds have suffered significant disruption and fragmentation. As Weingarten (2003: 236) comments: “In the interplay among telling, listening and reflecting, rudimentary coherence, continuity and connection can form. Repeated they can take hold. “

见证有助于任何社区日常生活中的社会修复，也有助于在个人和社会世界遭受严重破坏和分裂时的和解进程。正如 Weingarten（2003：236）所评论的那样：“在讲述、倾听和反思之间的相互作用中，可以形成初步的一致性、连续性和连接。反复进行，它们就能扎根下来。”

## *Working in the Here and Now*

## *在此时此地工作*

Bev Hosking recounts: *“In Angola an incident occurred where we were able to apply playback theatre in an immediate situation very effectively. Part way through the performance someone in the audience had an epileptic fit. At first it was very unclear what was happening and everyone experienced some degree of fear, panic and shock. Nearly everyone, performers and audience members alike, fled screaming from the jango (compound). The young man recovered well and was taken outside to rest.*

贝芙-霍斯金回忆道：*“在安哥拉发生的一起事件中，我们能够非常有效地将一人一故事剧场应用到当时的情况中。演出进行到一半时，观众中有人突发癫痫。起初大家都不清楚发生了什么，每个人都经历了一定程度的恐惧、惊慌和震惊。几乎所有人，包括演员和观众，都尖叫着逃离了简戈（大院）。那个年轻人恢复得很好，被带到外面休息。*

*The question then was if and how to proceed. Everyone was still in shock and it seemed important at least to bring people together, even briefly, before we finished, and the actors and the conductor agreed to this. The conductor invited the audience to talk about their experience of what had just happened. The first person told of feeling confused and not knowing what was happening, the second told of having felt really shocked and frightened and the third person told of feeling worried and concerned for the man. The actors were quite courageous and did some wonderful work playing these back as fluid sculptures. The second fluid sculpture very accurately mirrored the experience of the shock and there was awkward laughter and murmurs of recognition in response. My own experience with this sculpture was feeling the ‘shock’ leave my body.*

*接下来的问题是是否继续以及如何继续。每个人都还沉浸在震惊之中，在我们结束之前，至少要让大家聚在一起，哪怕是短暂的，这一点似乎很重要，演员和领航员都同意这样做。领航员请观众谈谈他们对刚刚发生的事情的感受。第一个人说自己感到困惑，不知道发生了什么；第二个人说自己感到非常震惊和害怕；第三个人说自己为那个人感到担心和忧虑。演员们勇气可嘉，将这些内容演绎成流动塑像，效果非常出色。第二个流动塑像非常准确地反映了震惊的体验，现场响起了尴尬的笑声和喃喃的认可声。我自己对这个雕塑的体验是感觉“震惊”离开了我的身体。*

*Following this, everyone seemed to be able to relax and wanted the performance to continue. There was one last story and we finished with some singing and dancing. Although rather shocking in itself, this incident provided a very immediate experience of using playback theatre to workwith a tense and difficult moment in the life of this community.”*

*之后，大家似乎都放松了下来，希望演出继续下去。最后一个故事结束时，我们载歌载舞。虽然这件事本身相当令人震惊，但它为我们提供了一个非常直接的体验，即利用一人一故事剧场来处理这个社区生活中的一个紧张而艰难的时刻”。*

Playback performers develop strong abilities to work in the here and now rather than delivering anything pre-planned. The capacity of the therapeutic group leader to work in the here and now is described in detail by Yalom (1998). In the example above, the playback teacher's and conductor's capacity and willingness to work in the here and now illustrates the immediacy with which this work can be done.

Playback 演员发展了在“此时此地”工作的强大能力，而不是提供任何预先计划好的东西。雅洛姆（1998）详细描述了治疗小组带领者在“此时此地”工作的能力。在上面的例子中，一人一故事教师和领航员在“此时此地”工作的能力和意愿说明了这项工作的即时性。

## *Fostering Social Inclusion*

## *促进社会包容*

During a playback theatre performance it is the job of the conductor to encourage a wide range of people from the audience to feel comfortable telling their stories. There is an underlying belief that each person's experience is of value and that it is important to create a place for everyone to be heard and seen. The conductor seeks out many different voices in a community on the assumption that while their stories remain untold, the value or respect that a community grants each member is limited. The capacity to foster social inclusion is a sign of skillful group leadership. Appendix 1 describes in more detail how this is achieved.

在一人一故事剧场演出中，领航员的职责是鼓励广大观众自如地讲述自己的故事。我们的基本信念是，每个人的经历都是有价值的，重要的是要为每个人创造一个被倾听和被看见的空间。领航员在社区中寻找许多不同的声音，因为他认为，如果他们的故事仍未被讲述，那么社区给予每个成员的价值或尊重都是有限的。促进社会包容的能力是娴熟的团体领导力的标志。附录 1 详细介绍了如何做到这一点。

In Kiribati<sup>11</sup> a playback theatre training project complemented other training aimed at increasing the participation of women in decision making. It also aimed to test whether playback theatre could influence and empower women within their families and local communities. The level of social inclusion generated in the playback training and performances had a positive impact on more than the relationships between men and women. One participant in the group was marginalized in his community because of his sexual orientation. He was isolated in the group, and often on the receiving end of harsh jokes. The trainers worked hard to include him at different points in the workshop and to value what he had to contribute. They also worked to build a strong enough relationship with him and with the group as a whole in order to create the conditions conducive for him to tell a story. This was not such an easy task.

在基里巴斯<sup>11</sup> ，一个一人一故事剧场培训项目补充了其他旨在提高妇女参与决策的培训。该项目还旨在检验一人一故事剧场是否能够影响家庭和当地社区的妇女并赋予她们权力。在一人一故事剧场培训和演出中产生的社会包容程度不仅对男女之间的关系产生了积极影响。小组中的一名参与者因其性取向而在社区中被边缘化。他在小组中被孤立，还经常被人取笑。培训师努力让他参与到工作坊的各个环节，并重视他的贡献。他们还努力与他以及整个小组建立足够牢固的关系，以便为他讲述故事创造有利条件。这并非易事。

11 In 1998-99 Bev Hosking and Christian Penny worked together in two villages of the South Pacific nation of Kiribati. They taught playback theatre as part of an overseas development project funded by the New Zealand government.

11 1998-99 年，Bev Hosking 和 Christian Penny 一起在南太平洋国家基里巴斯的两个村庄工作。作为新西兰政府资助的海外发展项目的一部分，他们教授一人一故事剧场。

Bev reflects, *“When we finally invited him to tell a story he accepted and came to the teller's chair with a vulnerability that was very poignant to witness. He told a story about building, then losing, a close friendship. His love for this friend was evident and there was a sense that perhaps for the first time he was able to say his friend's name in public. As they listened, the group was able to go beyond their stereotyped view of this man and to see his humanity. They enacted his story with a great deal of tenderness, compassion and respect. This proved to be a turning point in the relationship between this man and the group. That evening we observed a warmer, more expressive connection between a number of the participants and this man. For the rest of our time together we noticed a marked decrease in people singling him out for ridicule.”*

贝芙反思道：*“当我们最终邀请他讲述一个故事时，他接受了邀请，并带着一种脆弱的情绪坐到了讲述者的位置上，令人感慨万千。他讲述了一个关于建立，然后失去亲密友谊的故事。他对这位朋友的爱溢于言表，也许这是他第一次在公开场合说出朋友的名字。在倾听的过程中，小组成员超越了对这个人的刻板印象，看到了他的人性。他们以极大的温柔、同情和尊重演绎了他的故事。事实证明，这是这名男子与小组之间关系的转折点。当晚，我们观察到许多参与者与这名男子之间建立了一种更温暖、更富有表现力的联系。在接下来的相处过程中，我们注意到，人们对他的嘲笑明显减少了。”*

## *Expression of Strong Feelings*

## *表达强烈的情感*

Creating a community context for the telling of stories is a challenging and delicate process. Telling stories involves a move away from a rational, logical approach and opens out the imaginative and feeling dimensions of experience.

为讲故事创造社区环境是一个具有挑战性的微妙过程。讲故事需要摒弃理性、逻辑的方法，打开经验的想象力和感受力。

By its very nature reconciliation involves dealing with deep-seated and intense feelings relating to painful events, injustices and losses. To enable a movement away from adversarial and defensive positions, there needs to be a willingness to work with these rather than to close down the possibilities for expression. In his work with third generation Jews and Germans, Krondorfer (1995: 1) notes the need to be able to work with intense feelings and the importance of mourning in the reconciliation process. “To transform their strained relationships they must learn to trust each other and allow their long stored anger, guilt and pain to emerge.”

就其本质而言，和解涉及到与痛苦事件、不公正和损失有关的根深蒂固的强烈感受。为了摆脱对立和防御的立场，需要有一种意愿来处理这些情感，而不是封闭表达的可能性。Krondorfer (1995: 1)在与第三代犹太人和德国人的合作中指出，在和解过程中，需要有能力处理强烈的情感和哀悼的重要性。“为了改变紧张的关系，他们必须学会相互信任，让积蓄已久的愤怒、内疚和痛苦得以释放”。

In playback theatre as the audience develops trust in the process and in the performers‟ capacity to listen and respond, strong feelings such as despair, shame, grief, sadness, anguish, fear and anger as well as delight, deep appreciation and joy can be expressed. As a participant in the 2004 New Zealand Summer School observed: “The allowing of the expression of feelings of hurt enabled me to tell my story.”

在一人一故事剧场中，随着观众对演出过程以及演员的倾听和回应能力产生信任，绝望、羞愧、悲伤、难过、痛苦、恐惧、愤怒以及喜悦、深深的赞赏和欢乐等强烈的情感都可以表达出来。正如 2004 年新西兰暑期班的一位学员所说的那样“允许表达受伤害的感受使我能够讲述自己的故事”。

Both the playback structure itself and the efforts of the conductor combine to create an open and safe environment where these feelings can be held and contained. As feelings are expressed, participants may experience a catharsis and the release of new energy.

一人一故事结构本身和领航员的努力相结合，创造了一个开放和安全的环境，使这些情感得以保持和控制。随着情感的表达，参与者可能会体验到一种宣泄和新能量的释放。

This is illustrated in the telling and witnessing of stories of caste oppression in India, which are also stories of courage, endurance, ingenuity and compassion. The process of storytelling and enactment builds courage, inner and outer strength, and increasing pride in a group within Indian society for whom daily survival has been, and still is, precarious.

讲述和见证印度种姓压迫的故事就印证了这一点，这些故事也是勇气、耐力、智慧和同情心的故事。讲故事和演绎故事的过程培养了人们的勇气、内在和外在的力量，并增强了印度社会中这一群体的自豪感，对他们来说，日常的生存过去是、现在仍然是岌岌可危的。

During a training workshop for thirty field workers and activists working with issues of bonded labor<sup>12</sup> a man came forward to tell a story:

在为 30 名从事债务劳役问题工作的实地工作者和活动家<sup>12</sup>举办的培训工作坊上，一名男子站出来讲述了一个故事：

12 Bonded labor is a system under which a person is bonded to provide labor to repay a loan. The person is often trapped into working for little or no pay for seven days a week , sometimes for the duration of their life. The value of their work is invariably greater than the original sum of money borrowed.

12 债务劳役是一种制度，在这种制度下，一个人必须提供劳动力来偿还贷款。这些人往往被迫每周工作七天，报酬很少或没有报酬，有时甚至终生工作。他们工作的价值总是高于最初借贷的金额。

*“I was seven years old and my brother was five years old. There was not enough food to eat. My father was a bonded laborer and worked for the master and he was provided with food. At night my mother would send me and my brother to meet my father as he went to get his evening meal, We had no other way of getting food. My father would get two bowls of food, rice and dahl, just enough food for one person, and he would share his food with us. This worked well for a while although my father would never get any extra food.*

*“我七岁，弟弟五岁。食物不够吃。我父亲是个债役工，为主人干活，主人给父亲提供饭吃。晚上，母亲会让我和哥哥去找父亲，因为他有晚餐。父亲会拿两碗饭，米饭和大头菜，这些只够一个人吃，他会和我们分享他的食物。虽然父亲从来没有得到过多余的食物，但这一办法还是很管用的。*

*After a time the master saw what was happening, got angry and locked the gates to keep us out. However my brother and I would climb over the gates to meet up with our father. The master then began to set the dogs free at this time of the evening to keep us away. But we were so hungry that we still went to meet our father. Sometimes we were chased by the dogs and it was terrifying. One day when the dogs were loose, my brother fell over as he was running away and he was bitten. I could not help him. Every time I remember this, I lose all my strength.”*

*过了一段时间，主人看到了这一切，生气地锁上了大门，不让我们进去。但是，我和哥哥会翻过大门去找父亲。主人开始在晚上这个时候放狗，不让我们进去。但我们实在太饿了，还是去找父亲。有时，我们会被狗追赶，非常害怕。有一天放狗时，我哥哥在逃跑时摔倒了，被咬了一口。我没能救他。每次回忆起这件事，我都会失去所有的力气”。*

Two images from this story were enacted. The inhumanity expressed in the story was almost unbearable for the group to witness. The participants were highly distressed. It became apparent that many of them had stories of a similar nature that they had never told anyone. Following his story, there was an obvious need for others to tell their stories and to have them witnessed by their community. Bev reflects: “We decided that, for the rest of this session, telling was most important and we would not have enactments. So we sat together in a circle and listened to a number of very painful stories - stories of extreme poverty, hunger, shame, rejection and exclusion. The stories were terrible and the walls in the room seemed to bend just to hold them. There were many, many tears.

这个故事中的两个画面被演绎出来。故事中表现出的非人性几乎让小组成员无法忍受。参与者感到非常痛苦。显然，他们中的许多人都有类似的故事，但从未告诉过任何人。继他的故事之后，其他人显然需要讲述自己的故事，并让社区见证他们的故事。贝芙反思道：“我们决定，在这节课的剩余时间里，讲述是最重要的，我们将不进行演出。因此，我们围坐在一起，聆听了一些非常痛苦的故事--关于极端贫困、饥饿、羞耻、排斥和排挤的故事。这些故事非常可怕，房间里的墙壁似乎都要被这些故事压弯了。很多人都流下了眼泪。

After the session finished there was a short time of quiet reflection. Then the participants began drumming, dancing vigorously, singing and playing. This went on for about twenty minutes. “

活动结束后，大家进行了短暂的安静思考。然后，参与者开始击鼓、劲舞、唱歌和演奏。这样的活动持续了大约二十分钟。”

The Director of the non-government agency working on issues of bonded labor later reported that, although he had known some of these young people for 15 years, he had not heard these stories before. He also said that even though this was his work, he had never been quite so aware of the far-reaching effects of the poverty and degradation resulting from bonded labor. Listening to these stories had had a profound impact on him.

致力于解决债务劳役问题的非政府机构主任后来报告说，虽然他认识其中一些年轻人已经有 15 年了，但他以前从未听说过这些故事。他还说，尽管这是他的工作，但他从未如此深刻地意识到债务劳役造成的贫困和退化的深远影响。聆听这些故事对他产生了深远的影响。

Following this session, many of the participants reported that they felt less burdened by their past and that the sharing of these stories freed up a lot of energy and created connections among them. They also said that they could feel their commitment to the work with bonded labor in a new way.

会议结束后，许多与会者表示，他们感到过去的负担减轻了，分享这些故事释放了许多能量，并在他们之间建立了联系。他们还说，他们能以一种新的方式感受到自己对债务劳役工作的投入。

## *Generating New Perspectives*

## *创造新视角*

Playback theatre can also have a mirroring effect for the teller and the audience. They often enjoy seeing themselves, their stories, and their culture brought to life on stage. This ‘mirroring’ effect can affirm and strengthen both individual and community identity in contrast to the impact of selective images of a culture and sub-groups presented by the mainstream media. This can be a significant step in the process of community building for those affected by oppression and violence.

对于讲述者和观众来说，一人一故事剧场也能产生镜像效应。他们往往乐于看到自己、自己的故事和自己的文化在舞台上栩栩如生地演绎。这种“镜像”效应可以肯定和加强个人和社区的身份认同，与主流媒体所展示的文化和亚群体的选择性形象的影响形成鲜明对比。对于那些受压迫和暴力影响的人来说，这可能是社区建设进程中的重要一步。

Playback theatre portrayals also help audiences see their experience from the outside, including what happened to them and things they did to others. This can be a significant development in the process of reconciliation. Telling and seeing enactments of each other's stories can provide community members a new view or perspective on themselves, and can lead to questioning of accepted values and behavior. This is illustrated in the following description of a story told at a playback theatre training workshop held away from the participants‟ home locations:

一人一故事剧场还能帮助观众从外部看到他们的经历，包括发生在他们身上的事情以及他们对他人所做的事情。这可能是和解进程中的一个重要进展。讲述和观看彼此的故事可以让社区成员对自己有一个新的看法或视角，并能促使他们对公认的价值观和行为提出质疑。下面的例子是在远离参与者家乡的地方举办的一人一故事剧场培训工作坊上讲述的一个故事：

*“Two months ago, the teller who was a community worker, was in a village. A woman had returned from the fields before her husband but rather than preparing lunch had visited her friends. The husband got annoyed about this and the wife became very defensive and took her temper out on her daughter. The small girl became frightened, went inside in a hurry to light the fire, but had an accident with the kerosene. The parents and other members of the community were right outside but could not easily get into the burning house to help as the girl had locked the door. By the time the parents and the community worker got into the house it was too late to save the girl.”*

*“两个月前，身为社区工作者的讲述者来到一个村庄。一位妇女比丈夫先从田里回来，但她并没有准备午餐，而是去拜访了她的朋友。丈夫为此很恼火，妻子也变得非常自我防卫，并把脾气发在了女儿身上。小女孩受到惊吓，匆忙进屋点火，却不小心碰到了煤油。父母和其他社区成员就在屋外，但由于女孩把门锁上了，他们无法轻易进入着火的房子帮忙。当父母和社区工作人员进入屋内时，已经来不及救出女孩了。”*

Following the telling and enactment of this story the conductor inquired about what had happened to the mother. They were told that the people in the village had taken a very punitive attitude to her, that she had been ostracized in the village and that this was unlikely to change over the course of her lifetime.

在讲述和演绎完这个故事后，领航员询问了这位母亲的遭遇。他们被告知，村里人对她采取了非常严厉的惩罚态度，她在村里受到了排斥，而且这种情况在她的一生中都不可能改变。

As she spoke about this, one of the participants became very thoughtful and said that she suddenly became aware that this woman had already suffered enormously and had already been punished enough. She said that she now thought it would be good if she visited this woman and offered some support to her. Seeing the story performed and having the freedom and space to think about the event in a local context away from the village enabled a new perspective to emerge.

说到这里，一位与会者若有所思，她突然意识到这位妇女已经遭受了巨大的痛苦和惩罚。她说，她现在想，如果她能去看望这位妇女并为她提供一些支持，那将会是一件好事。通过观看故事演出，并在远离村庄的当地环境中拥有思考事件的自由和空间，这使我们产生了新的看法。

## *A Group-Centered Approach*

## *以小组为中心的方法*

The group-centered approach adopted by Playback theatre is an approach to working with groups well established in the field of group psychotherapy: the group defines its own agenda rather than having this imposed by the group leader. Interactions between group members and the overt content of what they say are clues to interpreting the group's central concerns and the conflicts they are experiencing.<sup>13</sup>

一人一故事剧场采用的以小组为中心的方法是一种在小组心理治疗领域行之有效的小组工作方法：由小组确定自己的议程，而不是由小组带领者强加给小组。小组成员之间的互动以及他们所说的公开内容，都是解读小组的核心问题和他们所经历的冲突的线索。<sup>13</sup>

13 Writers on a group-centered approach include W.R. Bion, Dale Richard Buchanan, D.S. Whitacker and M.A. Lieberman (see bibliography).

13 以小组为中心的方法的作者包括 W.R. Bion、Dale Richard Buchanan、D.S. Whitacker 和 M.A. Lieberman（见参考书目）。

In this spirit, playback theatre brings a wide range of stories to life on the stage. It is a lively approach which can generate delight and enjoyment. It mirrors all aspects of life including funny, lighthearted, ludicrous moments, moments of beauty, moments of distress, moments of humanity and moments of inhumanity.

本着这种精神，一人一故事剧场将各种故事搬上了舞台。这是一种生动活泼的方式，能带来愉悦和享受。它反映了生活的方方面面，包括滑稽、轻松、可笑的时刻，美好的时刻，痛苦的时刻，人性的时刻和非人性的时刻。

This contrasts significantly with more didactic or agenda-driven approaches to exploring social concerns where a more morally prescribed approach can limit the work and the range of expression. The use of personal story rather than a teaching approach opens up the possibilities of a new discourse.

这与探讨社会问题的说教式或议程驱动式方法形成了鲜明对比，在说教式或议程驱动式方法中，更多的道德规定可能会限制作品和表达的范围。使用个人故事而不是教学方法，开辟了新话语的可能性。

When using a group-centered approach, the group itself sets the agenda.

在采用以小组为中心的方法时，由小组自己制定议程。

Even a hint of judgment or political correctness will inhibit the range of stories told and narrow the frame of any exploration or dialogue. If that happens, participants only bring forward ‘socially acceptable’ stories and avoid real engagement. While all stories are influenced by the cultural and social perspective, prejudices, partial views, and limited knowledge of the teller, there is a need, highlighted by Burkett (2003: 13) to keep the teller's chair as an ideologically free and open space. This is essential to avoid playback theatre becoming “another conservative method of whitewashing difference which will only contribute to driving fears, hatreds, jealousies and paranoia further underground where it fuels possibilities of communal violence, destruction of processes and segregation mentalities.”

哪怕是一丝一毫的评判或政治正确，都会抑制故事的讲述范围，缩小任何探讨或对话的框架。如果出现这种情况，参与者只会提出“社会可接受的”故事，而不会真正参与其中。虽然所有故事都会受到讲述者的文化和社会视角、偏见、片面观点和有限知识的影响，但 Burkett（2003: 13）强调，有必要将讲述者的位置保持为一个意识形态自由和开放的空间。这对于避免一人一故事剧场成为“另一种粉饰差异的保守方法至关重要，它只会促使恐惧、仇恨、嫉妒和偏执进一步转入地下，从而助长社区暴力、破坏进程和隔离心理的可能性”。

Acceptance of the stories that *are* told is a highly valued aspect of this approach. At times on training workshops this central value is revisited when practitioners express impatience or frustration that stories are not ‘deep’ enough, not ‘political’ or not ‘political enough’.

接受所讲述的故事是这种方法的一个非常重要的方面。在培训工作坊上，当实践者对故事不够“深刻”、不具备“政治性”或“政治性不够”表示不耐烦或沮丧时，这一核心价值有时会被重新提及。

Bev Hosking reflects, “*In my experience a community tells stories that they are interested in and that they are ready to tell and listen to. We are building and, at times, re-building trust through a process of telling. As playback theatre practitioners we need to be very sensitive to this.*

贝芙-霍斯金认为：“根据我的经验，社区会讲述他们感兴趣的故事，他们愿意讲述和倾听这些故事。我们正在通过讲述的过程建立信任，有时是重新建立信任。作为一人一故事剧场实践者，我们必须对此保持高度敏感。

*Some subjects or areas of concern may be approached rather indirectly at first, or alluded to in a story and this needs to be respected. This is of particular relevance when the practitioner comes from outside the culture. They must be aware of politically and/or socially sensitive areas where revealing too much could put the teller at some risk.*

*有些主题或关注领域一开始可能会比较间接，或在故事中间接提及，这需要得到尊重。当实践者来自这个文化之外时，这一点尤为重要。他们必须意识到政治和/或社会敏感领域，在这些领域透露过多信息可能会给讲述者带来一定的风险。*

*Avoidance of some areas is likely to occur and this also needs to be respected. In some situations avoidance might be ‘mirrored back’ to the audience by the conductor and this may lead to an opening out into new areas of community concern. This mirroring needs to be done thoughtfully and with care. The practitioner needs to avoid thinking that they know what is good for the teller or the group. An important working principle for me is that the group chooses what to tell and when they tell.”*

*可能会出现回避某些领域的情况，这也需要得到尊重。在某些情况下，领航员可能会将回避的问题“反射”给听众，这可能会使听众进入社区关注的新领域。这种“镜像”需要深思熟虑，小心谨慎。实践者需要避免认为自己知道什么对讲述者或团体有利。对我来说，一个重要的工作原则是，由团体来选择讲述什么以及什么时候讲述”。*

A participant from the 2004 New Zealand Summer School describes her process of ‘warming up’ to telling a story: *“What people said felt extremely honest - this influenced me to want to find a more honest place with what was coming forward in myself. Then as more people told, I was impressed with the diversity of views and experiences; and the clarity with which they were expressed. This was very satisfying and on a couple of occasions I wanted to tell so that I could be more a part of that.”*

2004 年新西兰暑期班的一名学员描述了她讲述故事的“热身”过程：她说：“人们所说的话让我感到非常坦诚--这影响了我，让我想找到一个更坦诚的地方来表达我自己的想法。随着讲述的人越来越多，我对观点和经历的多样性以及表达的清晰度印象深刻。这让我非常满意，有几次我都想说出来，这样我就能更多地参与其中。

While some performances may be oriented around an appointed theme, what gets told is determined by the individual teller and the group. One of the roles of the conductor or group leader is to reflect back what is emerging in the group and build on it. There is always a sense of movement through the stories, a shifting between “states of vulnerability and states of resilience” (Griffith and Griffith, 2002: 232) although this is very rarely a linear process. Bev Hosking comments: *“We have noticed that there has been a definite movement in the stories, at all our Summer Schools, from stories that are a little bit removed to stories that are more personal, from ‘victim’ stories to stories of ‘agency’ where shame, guilt and responsibility have begun to be acknowledged.”*

虽然有些演出可能会围绕一个指定的主题，但讲述什么由讲述者个人和团体决定。领航员或团体带领者的作用之一就是反映团体中出现的情况，并在此基础上加以改进。故事总有一种流动感，在“脆弱状态和复原状态”（格里菲斯和格里菲斯，2002 年：232）之间转换，尽管这很少是一个线性过程。Bev Hosking 评论道：*“我们注意到，在我们所有的暑期学校中，这些故事都有一个明确的变化，即从略显抽离的故事到更加个人化的故事，从“受害者”的故事到“能动性”的故事，在这些故事中，羞愧、内疚和责任开始得到承认。”*

## *Capacity to Work Directly and Indirectly*

## *直接和间接工作能力*

*In Kiribati playback theatre was used to work with the whole community and all its stories, rather than making the topic of enhancing women's role in the community an explicit agenda item. Time after time during the playback theatre training both tellers of stories and the wider community were delighted, moved and challenged by seeing their world reflected through the enactment of their stories. As stories from women and men were told and performed, enough trust developed between the women and men in the group for some of the core stories and conflicts around gender to emerge. This happened privately in the workshop sessions and then more publicly in the performances.*

*在基里巴斯，一人一故事剧场被用来与整个社区及其所有故事合作，而不是以加强妇女在社区中的作用作为一个明确的议程项目。在一人一故事剧场培训期间，故事讲述者和更广泛的社区一次又一次地看到他们的世界通过他们的故事得到反映，从而感到高兴、感动和挑战。随着女性和男性故事的讲述和表演，小组中的女性和男性之间建立了足够的信任，一些围绕性别的核心故事和冲突也随之浮出水面。工作坊期间这种情况在私下发生，然后在演出中更加公开。*

*While introducing the idea that playback theatre is a means to work directly with social themes, a brief but potent exploration of the theme of equality between women and men took place. It ended with a story illustrating changing values about the relationship between women and men in this community. A woman told of her relationship with her father, which involved criticism, an overuse of power and physical beating. Her father had told her that she was bound to marry a good-for-nothing man. In fact she married a fine man who involved her in decisions, shared his successes and difficulties with her and was respectful of her. The teller and the audience were deeply affected by the enactment of this story, finding it both enjoyable and thought-provoking.*

*在介绍一人一故事剧场是直接处理社会主题的一种手段这一理念时，对男女平等主题进行了简短而有力的探讨。最后，通过一个故事说明了该社区男女关系价值观的变化。一位妇女讲述了她与父亲的关系，其中包括批评、过度使用权力和殴打。她的父亲告诉她，她注定要嫁给一个一无是处的男人。事实上，她嫁给了一个优秀的男人，他让她参与决策，与她分享成功和困难，并尊重她。讲述者和观众都被这个故事深深触动，觉得这个故事既有趣又发人深省。*

*Women aged from 14-56 years participated actively and equally as participants in the training workshops in group decision-making during the workshops and in leadership groups established in each community. They willingly told stories about their experiences, which made visible and acknowledged their contribution to community life. Impacts of the project were immediately observable in the day to day functioning of the participants. The women's shyness and self-consciousness dropped away and their confidence in presenting themselves in front of the group increased noticeably.*

*14-56 岁的妇女作为培训工作坊的参与者，积极、平等地参与了工作坊期间的团体决策以及在每个社区建立的领导小组。她们愿意讲述自己的经历，这些经历使她们对社区生活的贡献得到了认可。该项目对参与者日常工作的影响是立竿见影的。妇女们的害羞和个人顾虑消失了，她们在团体面前展示自己的信心明显增强。*

*The workshops provided an environment for modeling and enacting equality in the relationships between men and women. The trainers demonstrated an equal and respectful working partnership. Care was taken to ensure that women and men participated equally in group discussions and decision-making processes in an atmosphere of mutual respect.*

*工作坊提供了一个在男女关系中示范和实现平等的环境。培训人员展示了平等和相互尊重的工作伙伴关系。他们确保了女性和男性在相互尊重的氛围中平等参与小组讨论和决策过程。*

*The process of learning the basic skills of playback theatre in the training workshops created many opportunities for a growing understanding and strengthening of the relationships between women and men. They worked closely together and built on each other's work in creating dramatic enactments. They regularly chose actors to play roles in their stories without reference to gender and there was little difficulty in playing roles of the opposite gender. This was a powerful approach to facilitating greater understanding of the world of the other. Stories of ordinary daily activities from the lives of both women and men were listened to without judgment and the dramatic enactments were received with appreciation and delight. New pictures and possibilities of relationships between women and men were beginning to be voiced and witnessed in the community.*

*在培训工作坊上学习戏剧表演基本技能的过程为增进了解和加强男女之间的关系创造了许多机会。他们密切合作，相互借鉴，共同创作戏剧作品。他们经常不分性别地选择演员来扮演故事中的角色，在扮演异性角色时也没有什么困难。这种方法非常有效，有助于加深对他人世界的了解。人们不加评判地聆听了男女日常生活中的普通故事，并对戏剧表演表示赞赏和高兴。在社区中，人们开始表达和见证男女之间关系的新图景和可能性。*

Story is itself to some degree an indirect communication. Stories are multi-faceted, allowing a listener many entry points to understanding or learning. Jonathan Fox notes that “in stories, the value, the meaning, often reveals itself only indirectly” (1999:119).

*故事本身在某种程度上就是一种间接传播。故事是多方面的，让听众有许多切入点去理解或学习。乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathan Fox）指出，“在故事中，价值和意义往往只是间接地显现出来”（1999:119）。*

The work undertaken by Bev Hosking and Christian Penny in Kiribati described above illustrates how playback theatre can be used subtly and indirectly and well as directly on an area of social repair and development.

贝芙-霍斯金和克里斯蒂安-佩妮在基里巴斯开展的上述工作阐释了如何巧妙地、间接地以及直接地将一人一故事剧场用于社会修复和发展领域。

## *Capacity to Work with Ethnic Conflict*

## *处理种族冲突的能力*

Fiji has seen two coups in recent years, one in 1987 and one in 2000.

斐济近年来发生过两次政变，一次在 1987 年，另一次在 2000 年。

The population of Fiji comprises about 48% indigenous Fijians and 48% Indians who were brought to Fiji by the British between 1879-1916 as a workforce to harvest sugar. Both coups have involved expulsion of the democratically elected government, by the indigenous Fijian military.

斐济人口中约 48% 为土著斐济人，48% 为印度裔，印度裔是 1879-1916 年间英国人带到斐济的采糖劳动力。两次政变都是斐济土著军队驱逐民选政府。

During the May 2000 coup the Prime Minister and other Members of Parliament and government officials were held hostage for 56 days. Stimulated by these events, widespread racial tension and violence occurred between the indigenous Fijians and Indian communities in Fiji. Overnight divisions occurred between neighbors of different ethnicity who the day before had called each other ‘tavale’ (brother).

在 2000 年 5 月的政变中，总理和其他议员及政府官员被扣为人质长达 56 天。在这些事件的刺激下，斐济土著斐济人和印度裔社区之间出现了广泛的种族紧张关系和暴力事件。前一天还互称 “tavale”（兄弟）的不同种族邻居之间一夜之间就发生了分裂。

In September of that year the Save the Children Fund asked the Women's Action Forum to work with children in primary schools on a Post-Coup Trauma Counselling Project. This work was to specifically target children of 12-13 years of age. It had been identified that some participants in the 2000 coup had been 12-13yrs old at the time of the earlier 1987 coup. It was thought that during the first coup children of this age group had had experiences and developed attitudes that had led them to become involved in the recent coup**.** It was thought that if the effects of the recent coup on 12-13 year old children could be identified and worked with, some change could be possible. There was also an interest in developing a project to work creatively with the current conflicts at a grass-roots level so that on-going prejudice and discrimination could be minimized or avoided.

同年 9 月，拯救儿童基金要求妇女行动论坛与小学儿童合作开展“政变后创伤咨询项目”。这项工作专门针对 12-13 岁的儿童。经查明，2000 年政变的一些参与者在 1987 年政变时只有 12-13 岁。人们认为，在第一次政变期间，这个年龄组的儿童曾有过一些经历并形成了一些态度，这些经历和态度导致他们参与了最近的政变。他们认为，如果能够找出最近的政变对 12-13 岁儿童的影响并加以解决，就有可能发生一些变化。还有人希望制定一个项目，在基层创造性地解决当前的冲突，从而最大限度地减少或避免持续的偏见和歧视。

Initial investigation in schools explored the immediate impact of the recent coup and its aftermath on the children. An increase in violence, a lack of concentration, a lack of respect towards both students and teachers of different race, and an increase in racial tension were all widely reported.

对学校的初步调查探讨了近期政变及其后果对儿童的直接影响。暴力事件增加、注意力不集中、对不同种族的学生和教师缺乏尊重以及种族紧张关系加剧，这些都是广泛报道的内容。

WAC developed a theatre-based program in which they performed two scripted theatre pieces based on traditional stories with themes reflecting current areas of conflict - racism, jealousy, cheating and greed followed by playback theatre which invited the audience's responses and stories. The schools themselves were to provide any on-going support for the children following the performances.

WAC 制定了一项以戏剧为基础的计划，他们根据传统故事表演了两部剧本戏剧，主题反映了当前的冲突领域--种族主义、嫉妒、欺骗和贪婪，随后进行了一人一故事剧场演出，邀请观众作出回应并讲述故事。演出结束后，学校将为孩子们提供持续的支持。

The WAC performing group comprised five indigenous Fijians and one European. This ethnic composition has strong implications for the work, particularly in the Indian schools and communities where it had been difficult to build enough trust for people to be willing to come forward to tell their stories. However the fact that this group of primarily ethnic Fijians was willing to listen to and enact their stories of injustice and discrimination proved to be a very positive beginning to a reparative process. This had a strong impact on some people. At times the actors were visibly affected by the stories. One woman wept while playing the role of an Indian woman being humiliated as she was forced to do something which was culturally very unacceptable. This had a strong affect on the audience.

WAC 的演出小组由五名土著斐济人和一名欧洲人组成。这种种族构成对工作有很大影响，特别是在印度裔学校和社区，因为在这些地方很难建立足够的信任，让人们愿意站出来讲述自己的故事。然而，事实证明，这群主要由斐济族人组成的人愿意倾听并讲述他们遭受不公正和歧视的故事，这对补偿过程来说是一个非常积极的开端。这对一些人产生了强烈的影响。有时，演员们明显受到这些故事的影响。一位妇女在扮演一位印度裔妇女时流下了眼泪，因为她被迫做了一些在文化上非常不可接受的事情，从而受到了羞辱。这对观众产生了强烈的影响。

The program was offered to schools in both Fijian and Indian communities separately and in some schools that had a mix of students from both these communities. In many instances adult members of the communities were present and participated by telling their stories.

该计划分别向斐济族和印度裔社区的学校发出邀约，有些学校的学生同时来自斐济族和印度裔社区。在许多情况下，社区的成年成员都会出席并参与其中，讲述他们的故事。

In one town, during the initial stages of the project six months after the coup, the stories tended to be about panic, fear and violence. There was already a good degree of trust as many of the children already knew the theatre group from previous performances so they told their experiences readily. Many of the stories they told were quite shocking to everyone including the school staff and the performers. The teachers were often unaware of the extent of the violence that the children had been exposed to. The immediate effect was that the children experienced a great deal of relief and felt less isolated in being able to tell their stories and have them witnessed by their community.

在一个小镇，政变发生六个月后，在项目的初始阶段，孩子们讲述的往往是关于恐慌、恐惧和暴力的故事。由于许多孩子在以前的演出中已经认识了剧团，因此他们之间已经有了很好的信任，因此他们很乐意讲述自己的经历。他们讲述的许多故事让包括学校教职员工和演员在内的所有人都感到非常震惊。老师们往往不知道孩子们所接触到的暴力程度。这样做的直接效果是，孩子们感到了极大的欣慰，并因为能够讲述自己的故事并由社区见证而不再感到孤立无援。

Nine months after the coup, the project continued in schools located where the conflict had been extremely high. The performers noticed a shift in the themes of the stories. While stories about violence and the ensuing fear were still being told, the older children were now telling more reflective stories about their inner experience. They shared their feelings about what had happened and about what it had made them become. The stories were about tension, mistrust, separation from their old friends and their resulting grief about this.

政变九个月后，该项目在冲突极为激烈的学校继续进行。演员注意到故事的主题发生了变化。虽然讲述的仍然是暴力和随之而来的恐惧，但年龄较大的孩子现在讲述的更多是关于他们内心经历的反思性故事。他们分享了自己对所发生事件的感受，以及这些事件对他们的影响。这些故事讲述了紧张、不信任、与老朋友的分离以及由此产生的悲伤。

Strong themes of injustice, the unfairness of some situations, and shame began to emerge in the stories. The other prominent thread through the stories was fighting: how fighting does not make us feel better and how, in fact, it often makes us feels worse. In one of the more recent performances, a young man from a local village told of being involved in a fight and feeling very bad afterwards. That a man told this story in front of a school and in front of other men from his village was considered very unusual and came as a big surprise to the WAC group. They saw it as a sign of hope that attitudes to violence might be beginning to change.

故事中开始出现不公正、某些情况的不公平和羞耻等强烈的主题。故事中的另一个突出主题是打架：打架并不会让我们感觉更好，事实上，打架往往会让我们感觉更糟。在最近的一次演出中，一位来自当地村庄的年轻人讲述了他参与打架的经历，事后他感觉非常糟糕。一个人在学校和村里其他人面前讲述这个故事被认为是非常不寻常的，这让 WAC 的小组成员感到非常惊讶。他们认为这是一个希望的信号，表明人们对暴力的态度可能开始发生变化。

Even though very difficult and painful stories have been told in these performances, rather than escalate feelings of racial conflict, they have led to empathy and greater understanding. The performers report completing their performances with the feeling that they were leaving people as friends. People in the community were more friendly with each other and they also saw WAC as their friends. As they have met with people and listened to their stories, WAC have been surprised by the big-heartedness of the participants on both sides of the conflict and the interest in finding a way forward.

尽管在这些演出中讲述了非常困难和痛苦的故事，但这些故事非但没有使种族冲突的情绪升级，反而引发了共鸣和更多的理解。演员说，他们在完成表演后，感觉自己是以朋友的身份离开了人们。社区里的人们彼此更加友好，他们也把 WAC 视为自己的朋友。在与人们会面并倾听他们的故事时，WAC 惊讶地发现，冲突双方的参与者都心胸宽广，而且都有兴趣找到前进的道路。

## *Engaging in a Social Dialogue*

## *参与社会对话*

In playback theatre the stories told offer a window to the concerns and interests of the group or community. As stories are told they seem to relate to each other by addressing a common theme, echoing a motif or element, and seeming to answer or offer an alternative perspective to the stories told earlier.<sup>14</sup>. The playback theatre performance or workshop becomes a form of social dialogue.

在一人一故事剧场中，讲述的故事为了解群体或社区的关切和兴趣提供了一个窗口。在讲述故事的过程中，这些故事似乎相互关联，涉及一个共同的主题，呼应一个主题或元素，似乎回答了前面讲述的故事，或提供了另一种视角<sup>14</sup>。一人一故事剧场演出或工作坊成为一种社会对话形式。

14 Jonathon Fox has taught about this phenomenon and it is documented by Folma Hoesch as “The Red Thread: Storytelling as a Healing Process” in Fox and Dauber (1999).

14 乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathon Fox）曾讲授过这一现象，福尔玛-霍什（Folma Hoesch）将其记录为 Fox and Dauber (1999)中的“红线：作为治疗过程的叙事”。

Martin Buber (1958) used ‘dialogue’ to describe a mode of exchange among human beings in which there is a true turning to one another in full appreciation of the other, not as an object in a social function, but as a genuine being. A spirit of deep and respectful listening is generated in dialogue (Barbara Fritts, 1998).

马丁-布伯（Martin Buber，1958）用“对话”来描述人与人之间的一种交流模式，在这种交流模式中，人与人之间真正地相互倾听，充分地欣赏对方，不是把对方当作社会功能中的一个客体，而是把对方当作一个真正的存在。在对话中会产生一种深入和尊重的倾听精神（Barbara Fritts，1998）。

In contrast to debate, dialogue is not about having or winning an argument, but involves suspending judgment and listening with an open mind. “It is based on the assumption that by sharing all points of view and exploring new possibilities we can learn from difference and create a common wisdom” (Fritts, 1998).

与辩论不同的是，对话不是为了争论或赢得争论，而是要暂缓评判，以开放的心态倾听。“对话基于这样一种假设，即通过分享各种观点和探索新的可能性，我们可以从差异中学习，并创造共同的智慧”（Fritts，1998）。

David Bohm (1996) says “In dialogue people learn to think together by surfacing their fundamental assumptions and developing insight into how they arose.” Dialogue involves the deep exploration of different world views by surfacing the experiences that have contributed to them. The outcome of dialogue is that we feel heard and we can hear each other. This is achieved by paying attention to our own assumptions and reactions and those of others with a relaxed, non-judgmental curiosity. In this sense dialogue is a journey of discovery. “The primary activity of dialogue is to see things as freshly and clearly as possible” (Bohm, 1996).

大卫-博姆（David Bohm，1996）说：“在对话中，人们学会共同思考，浮现出他们的基本假设，并深入了解这些假设是如何产生的”。对话包括深入探讨不同的世界观，揭示产生这些世界观的经历。对话的结果是，我们感到自己的意见被倾听，我们能够倾听对方的意见。要做到这一点，我们必须以一种轻松的、不做评判的好奇心来关注自己和他人的假设和反应。从这个意义上说，对话是一次发现之旅。“对话的主要活动是尽可能新颖、清晰地看待事物”（Bohm，1996）。

The group-centered approach of playback theatre allows for the deep exploration of group concerns. These emerge as a deep dialogue embedded in the stories which are told and enacted. The relevance for this in reconciliation work is well illustrated in the following series of stories about race relations which were told during a ten day residential playback theatre Summer School in New Zealand<sup>15</sup> in 2002. The stories told start with an unexpected discovery by one group member that another participant speaks her language. They move on to a story of racial prejudice, a story of denied cultural origins and various stories about participating in, or being caught up in racial violence including helping neighbors or people at risk of violence. In some of these stories remorse and regret about these events are expressed.

一人一故事剧场以群体为中心的方法允许深入探讨群体关注的问题。在讲述和演绎故事的过程中，这些问题会以深入对话的形式出现。2002 年在新西兰举办的为期十天的一人一故事剧场暑期班<sup>15</sup>中，讲述了一系列有关种族关系的故事，充分说明了这一方法在和解工作中的现实意义。故事的开头是一位小组成员意外发现另一位参与者会说她的语言。接着，他们讲述了一个种族偏见的故事，一个被否认的文化起源的故事，以及各种关于参与种族暴力或被卷入种族暴力的故事，包括帮助邻居或面临暴力风险的人。其中一些故事表达了对这些事件的悔恨和遗憾。

15 The Playback Theatre Summer School is a residential training school held in New Zealand each year since 1998. It was initiated and is led by Bev Hosking and Christian Penny. The school is attended by playback theatre practitioners from many countries of the world.

15“一人一故事剧场暑期学校”是自 1998 年以来每年在新西兰举办的寄宿培训学校。该学校由贝芙-霍斯金和克里斯蒂安-佩妮发起和带领。来自世界许多国家的一人一故事剧场实践者参加了该学校。

A Chinese woman from Asia shrieks with surprise as a Melanesian woman from the Pacific speaks to her in Mandarin as they are performing together. It transpires that the Melanesian woman learned Mandarin in China where she spent two years as a student. There is wide-spread delight as the group witnesses this new and unexpected meeting.

一位来自亚洲的中国妇女在一起演出时，一位来自太平洋地区的美拉尼西亚妇女用普通话与她交谈，她惊讶地尖叫起来。原来，这位美拉尼西亚妇女在中国学习了两年普通话。大家目睹了这一出乎意料的新会面，普遍感到高兴。

The Chinese woman tells the first story of the workshop in which she mentions her fear about coming to New Zealand and spending ten days in a workshop with ‘amor’ (Europeans). There is considerable tension in the room as the story is told. The issue is very confronting so early in the workshop and the group is not ready to face it directly. The conductor does not deal with it directly and the performers do not portray the fear and the prejudice in their enactment.

中国妇女讲述了工作坊的第一个故事，她在故事中提到了自己对来到新西兰与“amor”（欧洲人）一起度过十天工作坊的恐惧。在讲述这个故事时，会议室里气氛相当紧张。在工作坊的初期，这个问题非常具有挑战性，小组还没有准备好直接面对它。领航员没有直接处理这个问题，演员也没有在演出中表现出恐惧和偏见。

The woman later tells a story about her relationship with her Peranakan<sup>16</sup> grandmother and her growing connection and interest in Peranakan culture. As her father had rejected this aspect of his cultural identity it was denied by her family as she grew up. The leaders invite the group to explore the values and world view of each character in the story, to understand some of the fears and beliefs contributing to the prejudice. The participants display courage, thoughtfulness and compassion. Their lack of judgement or blame is noticeable as they work to go beyond stereotypes. Their courage and the accompanying vulnerability is apparent to everyone.

后来，这位妇女讲述了她与土生华人奶奶<sup>16</sup>之间的关系，以及她与土生华人文化之间日益增长的联系和兴趣。在她的成长过程中，由于她的父亲摒弃了这方面的文化身份，因此她的家庭也否定了她的文化身份。带领者邀请小组成员探讨故事中每个人物的价值观和世界观，以了解造成偏见的一些恐惧和信念。参与者表现出勇气、深思熟虑和同情心。在他们努力超越陈规定型观念的过程中，他们明显缺乏判断或指责。他们的勇气和随之而来的脆弱对每个人来说都是显而易见的。

As the workshop continues there is reflection on the stories that are being told. A number of stories have been about other people's prejudice and about being on the receiving end of prejudice. The group is invited to consider how they might ask the audience to tell stories of their own prejudice. In a practice session group members grapple with the difficulty of doing this in an open-ended way, without teaching or preaching. A spirit of exploration appears essential, especially when there are strong feelings involved.

随着工作坊的继续，大家对所讲述的故事进行了反思。很多故事都是关于他人的偏见和自己遭受偏见的故事。小组被邀请考虑如何让听众讲述他们自己的偏见。在一次实践活动中，小组成员努力克服困难，以一种开放式的方式，在不教导或说教的情况下做到这一点。探索精神似乎是必不可少的，尤其是在涉及强烈情感的时候。

At the end of this session, building on this learning, a conductor invites the group to tell a story of a time when they themselves felt prejudiced towards someone else.

在这一环节结束时，在学习的基础上，领航员邀请小组成员讲述自己曾经对他人产生偏见的故事。

The person who comes to the teller's chair is an indigenous Fijian woman married to an Indian Fijian man. She tells a story from the time of the coup in May 2000. *“It was quite exciting at first as there was something new and different happening. Then suddenly I realised that perhaps my husband was not safe and I begin to be very worried. My husband who is a taxi driver picked me up at work and took me home so I would be safe. I wanted him to come home and stay safe, but he was keen to continue to work as there were so many people trying to get out of the middle of the city. In the end I agreed that he would do one more job before going home, but I insisted on going with him. It was terrifyingly chaotic in the town with people looting and running in all directions. Shop windows being broken and Indian people getting beaten up. I realised that my husband was in real danger. I finally persuaded him to go home with me. We picked up our child and hid in our house feeling very frightened and unsure whether we were really safe.”*

走上讲台的是一位斐济土著妇女，嫁给了一位斐济印度裔男子。她讲述了 2000 年 5 月政变时的故事。“起初，我感到非常兴奋，因为发生了一些新的不同的事情。后来我突然意识到我丈夫可能并不安全，我开始非常担心。我的丈夫是一名出租车司机，他到公司接我回家，这样我就安全了。我希望他能安全回家，但他很想继续工作，因为有很多人都在试图离开这座城市。最后，我同意他在回家之前再干一票，但我坚持要和他一起走。城里混乱得可怕，人们四处抢掠，四散奔逃。商店的窗户被打破，印度裔遭到殴打。我意识到我丈夫真的很危险。我最终说服他和我一起回家。我们抱起孩子躲在家里，感到非常害怕，不知道自己是否真的安全”。

There are three participants from Fiji in the workshop, and after a short break, the conductor makes an invitation for the other two to tell a story from this time of the 2000 coup. We continue an exploration of this event from different perspectives.

工作坊有三位来自斐济的参与者，短暂休息后，领航员邀请另外两位讲述 2000 年政变期间的故事。我们继续从不同角度探讨这一事件。

The next teller is an indigenous Fijian man. *“For weeks before the coup, the radio had been talking up a case against Indian Fijians. They were presenting a view of Indians taking over the businesses, employment and now the government. I came to accept this view. I was feeling angry and resentful about this situation and then I got caught up in the excitement generated by the coup and the temporary breakdown of the law and order.*

下一位讲述者是一位土著斐济人。*“政变前几周，电台一直在大肆宣扬针对印度裔斐济人的案件。他们认为印度裔接管了企业、就业，现在又接管了政府。我开始接受这种观点。我对这种情况感到愤怒和不满，然后我就被政变和暂时的治安混乱所激怒了。*

*Along with a couple of friends I wanted to do something to ‘get back’ at the Indians. We decided to go a village some distance away from our own community where we would not be recognized. Here we spent time throwing stones and rocks at the houses of Indian villagers. This went on for some time until a group of Indians came towards us brandishing long cane knives and began chasing us. I was frightened for my life but in the end we got away okay.*

*我和几个朋友想做点什么来“报复”印度裔。我们决定去一个离自己社区有一段距离的村庄，在那里我们不会被认出来。在那里，我们向印度裔村民的房子扔石头。这种情况持续了一段时间，直到一群印度裔挥舞着长长的藤刀向我们走来，开始追赶我们。我当时很害怕，但最终我们还是逃了出来。*

*However as we arrived back to the outskirts of our village, my friends and I saw an Indian man in the middle of the road up ahead. He was striking a cane knife on the surface of the road. We were again very frightened and we decided to attack him. I suddenly recognized this man as someone I knew quite well, but I was not able to tell my friends. They picked up a big rock and threw it at this man injuring him quite badly.*

*然而，当我们回到村子外围时，我和朋友们看到前面的路中间有一个印度裔。他正拿着一把藤刀在路面上敲打。我们再次感到非常害怕，于是决定攻击他。我突然认出这个人是我很熟悉的一个人，但我没能告诉我的朋友们。他们捡起一块大石头扔向这个人，把他打成重伤。*

*At this moment I suddenly woke up, I sort of came to my senses. This man was not some impersonal stereotype ‘Indian’, he was a neighbor. I realized that I had been caught up in doing something, I felt terrible. I still feel badly about this, and I have not told this story to anyone.”*

*此时此刻，我突然醒悟过来。这个人并不是什么不近人情的刻板印象中的“印度裔”，他是我的邻居。我意识到自己被卷入了一些事情中，我感觉很糟糕。我到现在还觉得很难过，我没有把这个故事告诉任何人”。*

The man is filled with grief as he watches the enactment and when he is able to speak afterwards he expresses regret and is very apologetic. *“I am so sorry about what happened. If only I could turn the clock back, if only I could undo what happened. He was a friend.”* His two colleagues from Fiji move from the audience to stand beside him.

在观看演出的过程中，这名男子悲痛欲绝，当他能够开口说话时，他表达了歉意和遗憾。“我对所发生的一切感到非常抱歉。如果时光能倒流，如果我能挽回所发生的一切，那该多好。他是我的朋友”。他的两位斐济同事从观众席中走出来，站在他身边。

After listening to and watching this story the group is quite shaken and is feeling how painful it is. We take some time to sit together and have some people bring forward their responses to the man and to his story. There is much appreciation of the teller and his courage to tell such a story. A number of people share about moments when they have done things they are not proud of. This includes a man from another Pacific nation. He is very distressed and tells about his experience during the earlier 1987 coup in Fiji when he was a young man studying in Suva. At that time he was involved in similar violent activities which he has continued to feel badly about since then. He has not told anyone about this and has not been able to come to terms with his actions. His regret and remorse is very evident. As with the earlier teller, the group is able to listen to this story with acceptance and compassion and do not move away from him.

在听完和看完这个故事后，小组成员都受到了很大的震动，感到非常痛苦。我们花了一些时间坐在一起，让一些人提出他们对这个人和他的故事的看法。大家对讲述者及其讲述这样一个故事的勇气表示赞赏。一些人分享了他们曾经做过的并不引以为豪的事情。其中包括一位来自另一个太平洋国家的人。他非常痛苦，讲述了自己在 1987 年斐济政变期间的经历，当时他还是一个在苏瓦学习的年轻人。当时，他也参与了类似的暴力活动，此后他一直为此感到难过。他没有将此事告诉任何人，也无法接受自己的行为。他的遗憾和悔恨非常明显。与之前的讲述者一样，小组成员能够以接纳和同情的态度倾听他的故事，并没有远离他。

Towards the end of this session someone begins to sing a song - a Bob Marley song that the Fijian man had taught earlier in the workshop: *‟Peace, perfect peace. I long for peace in our neighbourhood*”.

在这一环节接近尾声时，有人开始唱起了一首歌--这是斐济人在工作坊早些时候教过的鲍勃-马利的一首歌：“和平，完美的和平。我渴望我们邻里和平”。

The next teller is a European woman who has grown up in Fiji and has been a social activist for many years. She is full of feeling as she comes to the teller's chair. She is distressed at what is happening in Fiji as it is so far away from her vision of how life could be in Fijian society. She is disturbed at the degree to which greed has become such a motivating force in Fiji society and she is despairing about this.

下一位讲述者是一位在斐济长大的欧洲妇女，多年来一直是一名社会活动家。当她坐上讲述者椅子时，她充满了感情。她对斐济发生的一切感到痛心，因为这与她对斐济社会生活的想象相去甚远。她感到不安的是，斐济社会被贪婪驱使着，她对此感到绝望。

*“Dr Bavadra, an indigenous Fijian, was the Prime Minister ousted by the first coup in 1987. He was a brilliant man and a wonderful leader who was beginning to make some significant changes that were affecting life for many ordinary people in Fiji, particularly in the areas of health and education. He was a man with a big vision and there was a strong feeling of hope in the general community about what could be achieved with his leadership. I was and am still very upset by his undemocratic removal from office.*

*“巴瓦德拉博士是斐济土著人，是 1987 年第一次政变中被赶下台的总理。他是一个杰出的人，也是一位出色的带领者，他开始进行一些影响斐济许多普通人生活的重大变革，特别是在卫生和教育领域。他是一个具有远见卓识的人，广大民众对在他的带领下能够取得的成就充满希望。我过去和现在都对他被不民主地免职感到非常不安。*

*In the middle of the night of the 2001 coup, an Indian man whom I knew came to my place asking for shelter. He was an ex-prisoner and was running away from the riots and smashing of shops because he was afraid that he would be blamed and beaten by the police. He needed a place where he could feel safe. I was more than happy to give refuge to this man as some small contribution I could make. As I sheltered him, I realized that I just did not know how to respond to this latest coup and I felt an overwhelming grief and despair about the situation in Fiji.”*

*2001 年政变的半夜，我认识的一名印度裔男子来到我的住处请求庇护。他是一名刑满释放人员，因为害怕受到警察的指责和殴打，他从骚乱和打砸商店中逃了出来。他需要一个能让他感到安全的地方。我非常乐意为他提供庇护，这也是我能做出的一点贡献。在庇护他的过程中，我意识到我不知道该如何应对最近的政变，我对斐济的局势感到无比悲痛和绝望。”*

After seeing her story the woman realized just how much she had lost hope and was struggling to hold on to a vision that is inclusive of the different groups that comprise Fijian society. She was also aware of the lack of any real leadership and anyone expressing a vision for the future for the country. She became more aware of the importance of good leadership and became thoughtful about ways her organization could respond to this.

在看到她的故事后，这位妇女意识到自己已经失去了多少希望，并且正在努力坚持一个能够包容斐济社会不同群体的愿景。她还意识到，斐济缺乏真正的领导力，也没有人表达对国家未来的愿景。她更加意识到良好领导力的重要性，并开始思考她的组织如何应对这一问题。

The European woman chooses the same man from the Pacific nation to play the role of Dr Bavadra, the Prime Minister, in her story. He plays this role with great dignity and humanity. Following the enactment he is very moved and appreciates the experience of playing this role.

这位欧洲女性在她的故事中选择了同一位来自太平洋国家的男子扮演总理巴瓦德拉博士。他以极大的尊严和人性扮演了这个角色。演出结束后，他非常感动，并对扮演这一角色的经历表示感谢。

He goes on to tell a story of being caught in some riots in his home country and being able to take to safety a couple of foreigners who were at risk. He speaks of the fear of the chaos and his shy pride in having been able to help is visible. To some degree this is a counter to his earlier story of shame.

他接着讲述了自己在家乡遭遇暴乱，并将几名处于危险中的外国人带到安全地带的故事。他说到了对混乱的恐惧，并为自己能够提供帮助而感到羞涩和自豪。在某种程度上，这与他之前的羞愧故事形成了反差。

The next teller is a woman from another Pacific nation:

下一位讲述者是一位来自另一个太平洋国家的妇女：

*“I was a student in Beijing at the time when the US planes dropped a bomb on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. My friend and I were going to the High Commission for Papua New Guinea, which also serves other Pacific nations. This building was close to the American embassy in Beijing. As we approached the High Commission we found ourselves in the middle of a very big, very angry demonstration against the actions of the US military.*

*“美国飞机轰炸中国驻贝尔格莱德大使馆时，我正在北京读书。我和我的朋友要去巴布亚新几内亚高级专员公署，它也为其他太平洋国家服务。这座大楼离美国驻北京大使馆很近。当我们走近高级专员公署时，发现自己正处于一场声势浩大、非常愤怒的反对美国军方行动的示威游行中。*

*Some protesters mistakenly thought we were African–Americans. They began to yell at us, push us around, treat us roughly and then threatened us with guns for quite a long time. We were terrified and we thought they were going to kill us. We were unable to make ourselves and our situation understood. Fortunately a Chinese man from the High Commission saw what was happening and managed to persuade the protestors that we were from the Pacific and not American and we were able to escape to the safety of the High Commission. I have never been so frightened in my life.”*

*一些抗议者误以为我们是非裔美国人。他们开始对我们大喊大叫，推搡我们，粗暴对待我们，然后用枪威胁我们，持续了很长时间。我们吓坏了，以为他们要杀了我们。我们无法使自己和自己的处境得到理解。幸运的是，高级专员公署的一名中国人看到了所发生的一切，并设法说服抗议者，让他们相信我们来自太平洋地区，不是美国人，我们才得以逃到高级专员公署的安全地带。我一生中从未如此害怕过。”*

After witnessing this story, the Chinese woman from Asia is very upset and says to the woman from the Pacific nation: *“I am sorry this happened to you. Nobody should ever have to experience this. Even though I am not from China, I am very sorry that you were treated in this way by Chinese people.”*

目睹了这个故事后，这位来自亚洲的中国妇女非常难过，她对这位来自太平洋国家的妇女说*“我很抱歉你遭遇了这样的事情。没有人应该经历这样的事情。虽然我不是中国人，但我对中国人这样对待你感到非常抱歉。”*

This is the last story in the workshop and there is a profound feeling of satisfaction as the group sits together and reflects on the path they have travelled through these stories and the connections and interconnections that have emerged.

这是工作坊的最后一个故事，当小组成员坐在一起，回想他们通过这些故事所走过的路，以及所产生的联系和相互关联时，大家都深感满足。

There is a greater awareness of the nature of prejudice and the fact that no one group is immune to the depersonalizing process involved. There is an awareness of the painful impact of prejudice on others and of the restricting experience of shame when we act in ways that are contrary to our deeper values. The telling and listening to such stories and allowing themselves to feel about them had the effect of assisting participants to be able to learn from our experience as well as freeing them to move on. It also seemed to generate a greater commitment to becoming conscious of their own attitudes and the effects of these on their behavior.

对偏见的本质有了更深刻的认识，并意识到没有一个群体能够幸免于这种人格解体的过程。人们意识到偏见对他人造成的痛苦影响，以及当我们的行为与自己的深层价值观相悖时，羞耻感所带来的限制性体验。通过讲述和倾听这些故事，让参与者自己去感受这些故事，可以帮助他们从我们的经历中吸取教训，并使他们能够继续前行。这似乎也使他们更加致力于意识到自己的态度以及这些态度对其行为的影响。

## *Developing the Abilities Needed for Reconciliation*

## *培养和解所需的能力*

The capabilities and values intrinsic to playback theatre are relevant capacities for individuals and groups involved in reconciliation. This paper shows how conducting playback theatre performances can contribute to reconciliation efforts. Participation in playback theatre training is a significant capacity-building activity in its own right.

一人一故事剧场所固有的能力和价值对于参与和解的个人和团体来说都是相关的能力。本文介绍了如何通过一人一故事剧场的演出促进和解工作。参加一人一故事剧场培训本身就是一项重要的能力建设活动。

Such participation develops a range of abilities including attentive listening, the capacity to enter into the world of the other, receptivity and empathy. The work requires the capacity to ‘hold’ complexity, enter into the unknown, allow vulnerability and accept strong feelings. Courage, spontaneity and flexibility are needed. Group leadership skills are also required. The latter are described in more detail by Clayton (1989, 1994) and by Clayton & Carter (2004) and some are highlighted in Appendix 1.

这种参与可以培养一系列能力，包括专注倾听、进入他人世界的能力、接受能力和同理心。这项工作需要“保持”复杂性、进入未知世界、允许脆弱和接受强烈感受的能力。需要勇气、自发性和灵活性。此外，还需要团体带领技能。Clayton (1989, 1994) 和 Clayton & Carter (2004) 对后者有更详细的描述，附录 1 重点介绍了其中一些。

In training settings and in performance the core values of respect, relationship, acceptance, inclusion, enquiry, compassion, and creativity are at the heart of the work and have a positive modeling effect on the participants and the audience.

在培训和演出中，尊重、关系、接纳、包容、探究、同情和创造力等核心价值观是工作的核心，并对参与者和观众产生积极的示范效应。

As playback theatre is essentially a theatre of listening, development of the capacity to listen is central. This involves listening to what is told and what is not told, to the spoken word and to the silences. There is a listening for the personal dimension in a story and also to the social, cultural and political resonances in what is told.

由于一人一故事剧场本质上是一种倾听的戏剧，因此倾听能力的培养至关重要。这包括倾听讲述和未讲述的内容，倾听有声语言和无声语言。既要倾听故事中的个人层面，也要倾听故事中的社会、文化和政治共鸣。

A participant at the New Zealand Summer School in 2004 reflects: *“Everyone, irrespective of language, was required to be more attentive to gesture, facial expression and mood; to try and tune in to the unspoken frequencies that were passing between us. I really valued being in an environment where the huge number of assumptions we make about what other people understand was always being called into question and tested.”*

2004 年新西兰暑期班的一名学员写道：“每个人，无论使用哪种语言，都必须更加注意手势、面部表情和情绪；努力去捕捉我们之间传递的无声的频率。在这样一个环境中，我们对他人的理解所做的大量假设总是受到质疑和考验，我非常珍惜这样的环境”。

This work of deep listening builds receptivity and empathy, which are further enhanced by the training in play and improvisation. In play we can imaginatively enter the world of the other or of many others. This involves a process of discovery and understanding. We begin to move from our own stereotypes and frames of reference to see the world from different perspectives. *“Play makes us to recognize that any particular referential perspective is relative”* (Ruud, 1995:94). “Play allows a shift of rules, a shift between different positions” (Etchells, 1995 cited in Murray, 2003).

这种深度倾听的工作培养了接受能力和同理心，而游戏和即兴表演的训练又进一步增强了这种能力。在游戏中，我们可以富有想象力地进入他人或许多他人的世界。这需要一个发现和理解的过程。我们开始摆脱自己的成见和参照系，从不同的角度看世界。“游戏使我们认识到任何特定的参照视角都是相对的”（Ruud，1995:94）。“游戏允许规则的转换，不同立场之间的转换”（Etchells, 1995 cited in Murray, 2003）。

However the movement towards viewing the world from the position of the other is not always easy or straightforward to develop, especially when working with significant differences. Clayton (1993:60) notes the challenges of bringing depth to the enactment of the roles of people who have a very different value system, but asserts that even a superficial enactment brings about an embryonic development that can be built on at a later stage.

然而，从他人的立场来看待世界并不总是那么容易或那么直接，尤其是在处理重大差异时。克莱顿（Clayton，1993:60）指出，对于价值观体系大相径庭的人来说，要深入理解他们的角色是一项挑战，但他也断言，即使是肤浅的理解也会带来雏形的发展，而这种雏形可以在以后的阶段继续发展。

In play there is a continual shifting between initiating and following, and this requires both flexibility and co-operation. A basic level of trust is required and the work also builds trust. Saying ‘yes’ to someone else's initiative allows them to take us into the unknown and into the new. This builds courage and daring in the face of not-knowing,

在游戏中，发起者和跟随者的身份不断互换，这需要灵活性和合作性。这需要基本的信任，工作也能建立信任。对别人的提议说“是”，可以让他们带我们进入未知和新的领域。这可以培养我们面对未知的勇气和胆识。

The capacities described here help playback theatre practitioners relate to the life experiences of a wide range of people. However using playback theatre in some reconciliation contexts requires specific understanding of the effects of trauma on individuals and communities. Additional training and collaboration with agencies which have this understanding is recommended.

这里描述的能力有助于一人一故事剧场实践者与广泛人群的生活经历建立联系。然而，在某些和解环境中使用一人一故事剧场需要对创伤对个人和社区的影响有具体的了解。建议进行更多培训，并与了解这些知识的机构合作。

# Discussion of Applications and Challenges

# 讨论应用和挑战

## *Current Applications Relevant to Reconciliation*

## *当前与和解有关的应用*

This paper describes playback theatre training events and performances at which a range of group and community concerns have been explored. As illustrated, these concerns have included the effects of ethnic violence, war, social conflict, oppression and discrimination.

本文介绍了一人一故事剧场培训活动和演出，在这些活动和演出中，探讨了一系列群体和社区关注的问题。这些例子中，这些问题包括种族暴力、战争、社会冲突、压迫和歧视的影响。

Mostly the work described in detail in this paper was not initiated with the specific focus or intention to work towards reconciliation, although sometimes it did have related social development aims. Exceptions to this include the playback theatre performances for children conducted in Fiji after the military coup in 2000 and work in Burundi and the USA referred to in footnote 8.

本文中详细描述的工作大多不是以致力于和解为具体重点或意图而启动的，尽管有时确实有相关的社会发展目标。例外情况包括 2000 年军事政变后在斐济开展的儿童戏剧表演，以及脚注 8 中提到的在布隆迪和美国开展的工作。

The paper portrays playback theatre events in a range of settings, each offering particular advantages and challenges. Some are conducted in situ in the village, locality or country of the performing troupe, while others take place at international training events and conferences. As we consider how playback theatre might be further used in reconciliation efforts, it is worth exploring what each of these settings makes possible.

本文描绘了在各种环境下开展的一人一故事剧场活动，每种活动都具有特定的优势和挑战。有些活动是在演出团队所在的村庄、地区或国家就地开展的，而其他活动则是在国际培训活动和会议上进行的。在我们考虑如何在和解工作中进一步利用一人一故事剧场时，值得探讨一下这些环境中的每一种环境所带来的可能性。

## Working in Situ

## 现场工作

Work in situ with local performers (such as the work in Kiribati, India, Angola and Fiji) offers several advantages for the local participants.

与当地演员进行在地的合作（如在基里巴斯、印度、安哥拉和斐济开展的工作）为当地参与者带来了若干好处。

People enjoy seeing themselves, their stories, and their culture brought to life on stage by members of their own community. It has a mirroring affect that can be very affirming and which strengthens community identity.

人们喜欢看到自己、自己的故事和自己的文化被自己社区的成员搬上舞台。它有一种镜像效应，可以非常肯定并加强社群认同。

Working in situ, people can use their own language, their own cultural idiom and forms of expression. This can be freeing, validating and strengthening. In Kiribati participants were encouraged to work with their strength as singers. A small group of 5-6 singers accompanied the actors, in contrast to the one or two musicians more usual in playback theatre.

在地工作中，人们可以使用自己的语言、自己的文化习惯和表达方式。这可以是自由的、有效的和强大的。在基里巴斯，我们鼓励参与者发挥自己作为歌手的优势。一个由 5-6 名歌手组成的小组为演员伴奏，这与一人一故事剧场中常见的一两名乐师不同。

Occasionally working in situ can increase the difficulty for participants of ‘standing in the shoes’ of some people who are highly marginalized in their own community. This can arise from ignorance, prejudice and at times because of previous hurts, or anger at the person or group concerned. However, over time this can change, as enough trust is built for tellers from the marginalized sub-groups to come forward. As someone tells a story this can also shift a commonly held view of a member of the community.

有时，现场工作会增加参与者“站在”一些在自己社区中被严重边缘化的人的立场上的难度。这可能是由于无知、偏见，有时也可能是由于以前受到的伤害或对有关个人或群体的愤怒。然而，随着时间的推移，这种情况会发生变化，因为建立了足够的信任，边缘化亚群体的讲述者才会站出来。当有人讲述故事时，也会改变人们对社区成员的普遍看法。

Coming from outside to work in a different cultural context, with people in their own locality, poses challenges for the playback theatre practitioner. As an outsider they must invest more energy in absorbing and relating to local cultural norms and circumstances. Because there are many things they will not understand an attitude of genuine interest and enquiry is needed. It is important to realise that there are some things an outsider will not be invited to understand.

从外部来到一个不同的文化背景下，与当地人一起工作，这对一人一故事剧场实践者提出了挑战。作为外来者，他们必须投入更多精力吸收当地的文化规范和环境，并与之建立联系。因为有许多事情他们无法理解，需要抱着真正的兴趣和探究的态度。重要的是要认识到，有些事情外来者是无法理解的。

The work of playback theatre requires practitioners, particularly the conductor, to adopt an attitude of genuine interest and enquiry. Coming from outside presents numerous opportunities for practitioners to accept not-knowing and to learn in a rich way through the immediate relationships built and the stories told. Peter Brook (2000: 112) observes that theatre becomes “life in a more concentrated form” if there is no sense of an act of charity, only the feeling that one group of human beings wants to make contact with the other.

一人一故事剧场的工作要求实践者，尤其是领航员，抱着真正感兴趣和探究的态度。来自外部的演出为实践者提供了许多机会，让他们接受未知，并通过建立的直接关系和讲述的故事以丰富的方式进行学习。彼得-布鲁克（Peter Brook，2000 年：112）指出，如果没有慈善行为的觉知，只有一群人希望与另一群人接触的意愿，那么戏剧就只会成为“更集中形式的生活”。

Their role as an outsider can also make some things possible. The outsider has more distance, is not one of the players in the bigger on-going story and therefore does not so easily get caught up in the content and emotions of the stories told. An outside facilitator can ‘hold’ a community and enable some stories to be told that might not otherwise be told. Examples of this include the stories told in India of the hungry children chased by the landlord's dogs and of torture by the local police.

他们作为外来者的角色也会使一些事情成为可能。外来者有更多的距离感，不是正在发生的大故事的参与者之一，因此不会轻易被故事的内容和情感所吸引。外部的带领者可以“承托”一个社群，使一些原本可能无法讲述的故事得以讲述。这方面的例子包括在印度讲述的被地主家的狗追赶的饥饿儿童和被当地警察折磨的故事。

Being an outsider also means the visiting teacher may be less constrained by cultural norms and is able to stimulate the group's creativity in unexpected ways. This is illustrated in Bev Hosking's early work with playback theatre in Singapore. She encouraged participants from Chinese, Indian and Malay cultural backgrounds to tell and to listen to each other's stories in English, but perform speaking their first languages on stage. This request went against the norm in Singapore where English is the common language and is required in mixed groups. As they took up Bev's suggestion, the group found that using words was no longer their primary method of communication. Suddenly they woke up to a new potential and their delight and interest was evident.

作为外来者还意味着客座教师可能较少受到文化规范的约束，能够以意想不到的方式激发团体的创造力。贝芙-霍斯金（Bev Hosking）早期在新加坡开展的一人一故事剧场工作就说明了这一点。她鼓励来自华人、印度裔和马来人文化背景的参与者用英语讲述和聆听对方的故事，但在舞台上表演时要讲自己的母语。在新加坡，英语是通用语言，在混合团体中必须使用英语。当他们接受了贝芙的建议后，发现语言不再是他们的主要交流方式。他们突然发现了一种新的潜力，他们的喜悦和兴趣显而易见。

*“It seems to me that they began to experience each other in fresh ways and I observed a new quality in their relationships with each other, one where they acknowledged their differences”,says Bev. “In this situation my naivety as an outsider had a positive outcome. I stumbled into an area that was politically sensitive. But in the spirit of play I was able to work with it and in fact opened out a new area of discovery. As an outsider I was not so caught in the ongoing cultural tensions and had a certain freedom and room to move. However, generally speaking caution and sensitivity are needed in this sort of situation.”*

*贝芙说：“在我看来，他们开始以全新的方式体验彼此，我观察到他们之间的关系有了一种新的特质，那就是他们承认彼此的差异。在这种情况下，我作为外来者的天真带来了积极的结果。我无意中进入了一个政治敏感的领域。但本着游戏的精神，我能够与之合作，并在事实上开辟了一个新的发现领域。作为外来者，我没有被持续的文化紧张局势所束缚，有了一定的自由和活动空间。不过，一般来说，在这种情况下需要谨慎和敏感。”*

While playback theatre seems simple, the component skills take a long time to develop and integrate. For this reason in situ playback theatre training requires follow-up training and support, especially in new contexts where it is unclear where and how playback theatre will ‘land’ culturally. For example, the work in the Pacific nation of Kiribati in 1998-99 involved two visits, eight months apart.

虽然一人一故事剧场看似简单，但其中的技能需要长时间的培养和整合。因此，在地的一人一故事剧场培训需要后续培训和支持，尤其是在新的环境中，因为在这种环境中，一人一故事剧场在文化上的“落脚点”在哪里以及如何“落脚”尚不清楚。例如，1998-99 年在太平洋国家基里巴斯开展的工作包括两次访问，每次相隔 8 个月。

*“Quite a lot of the playback theatre forms and framework were lost in the time between our visits so we had to revisit the basics. A variation on the playback theatre form had emerged which looked more like the social action theatre that delivers a message or teaches something, a form with which they were more familiar. These groupsneeded more regular mentoring in the early phase than they received. “*

“在我们访问的间隙，很多一人一故事剧场的形式和框架都丢失了，因此我们必须重温基础知识。一人一故事剧场形式出现了一种变体，看起来更像是传递信息或传授知识的社会行动剧场，这是他们更熟悉的一种形式。这些团体在早期阶段需要比他们得到的更多的定期指导。”

## Working in International Settings

## 在国际环境中工作

There is also considerable value in playback theatre practitioners participating in international training events and conferences. In these settings mixed groups can help to build understanding across cultures and stimulate significant learning. This is illustrated in the following story about an Indian participant's experiences at an international playback theatre conference:

一人一故事剧场实践者参加国际培训活动和会议也有相当大的价值。在这些场合，混合团体有助于建立跨文化的理解，并促进重要的学习。下面这个故事讲述了一位印度与会者在一次国际一人一故事剧场会议上的经历：

He attended a workshop session at which a German man told a story about the family secrets surrounding his uncle's involvement with the SS Nazis in the Second World War. This story was played back very powerfully by a group of Swiss, French, Hungarian, Australian and NZ actors, two of whom were Jewish. The Indian man accompanied them as the musician. This performance was a strong experience for everyone in the room and the group's courage in listening and enacting this story was impressive.

他参加了一次工作坊，会上一位德国人讲述了他叔叔在第二次世界大战中参与纳粹党卫军的家族秘密。这个故事由一群瑞士、法国、匈牙利、澳大利亚和新西兰演员（其中两位是犹太人）演绎得非常生动。印度裔作为乐师为他们伴奏。这场演出给在场的每一个人都带来了强烈的震撼，他们倾听和演绎这个故事的勇气令人印象深刻。

The next day the man told Bev that he was extremely surprised by what had happened. He was amazed that a German man would tell such a story and that the Jewish participants were willing to listen to and play in this story. He said that he had never imagined that this could be possible.

第二天，这名男子告诉贝芙，他对发生的事情感到非常惊讶。他感到惊讶的是，一个德国人竟然会讲这样一个故事，而且犹太参与者也愿意听这个故事并参与其中。他说，他从未想象过这是可能的。

He also said that as a result of this experience, for the first time in his life he was able to imagine the possibility of a so-called high-caste person and a so-called low-caste person being in the same room together and listening to each other's stories. Before then he had never pictured this: it was beyond anything he had ever imagined. Since that time he has taken forward this vision, by creating and now working with a mixed caste group in India.

他还说，由于这次经历，他有生以来第一次能够想象所谓的高种姓人和所谓的低种姓人在同一个房间里一起听对方讲故事的可能性。在此之前，他从未想象过这种情况：这超出了他的想象。从那时起，他就将这一设想付诸实践，在印度创建了一个混合种姓小组，现在正与该小组合作。

In contrast to being an outsider providing training in other countries, at international training events at home such as the New Zealand Playback Theatre Summer School, the group leaders can adopt the role of host. This includes attending to the needs of the participants at many different levels including leading meaningful rituals of welcome, thanksgiving and farewell, providing food and accommodation and giving personal attention, support and even guidance on matters such as access to the local mosque.

与作为外来者在其他国家提供培训不同，在国内举办的国际培训活动（如新西兰一人一故事剧场暑期学校）中，小组负责人可以扮演东道主的角色。这包括在许多不同层面上满足学员的需求，包括主持有意义的欢迎、感恩和告别仪式，提供食宿，给予个人关注、支持，甚至在进入当地清真寺等问题上提供指导。

A significant element of the New Zealand Summer School is the use of Maori powhiri (greeting) and poroporoaki (farewell) ceremonies conducted in Maori language led by Christian Penny and other participants of Maori descent with participation by others using the English or other languages. These rituals which are engaging and moving events for the participants involved.

新西兰暑期学校的一个重要内容是使用毛利语举行“powhiri”（问候）和“poroporoaki”（告别）仪式，由克里斯蒂安-佩妮和其他毛利后裔参加者用毛利语主持，其他人用英语或其他语言参加。这些仪式对参加者来说都是引人入胜和令人感动的活动。

The New Zealand Summer School has now run for 6 consecutive years, with a number of participants returning more than once. This has enabled the work to evolve and deepen over time as relationships have developed and grown stronger.

新西兰暑期学校已经连续举办了 6 年，许多学员都不止一次参加。随着时间的推移和关系的发展和加强，这项工作得以不断发展和深化。

# Further Considerations

# 进一步的考虑

## *Limited Reach*

## *有限的覆盖范围*

Playback theatre is often performed for 20-100 audience members and sometimes up to 400 or more. Playback theatre aims to develop connections within the audience and between the audience and the performers. Its community-building nature means it is not well suited for a mass audience, such as those seen at a music concert or a football game. Because of its intimate nature it simply does not have the ‘reach’ of many other art forms and this may limit its efficacy in reconciliation efforts.

一人一故事剧场通常为 20-100 名观众演出，有时多达 400 人或更多。一人一故事剧场旨在发展观众内部以及观众与演员之间的联系。它社群建设的性质意味着它不太适合大众观众，如音乐会或足球比赛中的观众。由于其私密性，它根本不具备许多其他艺术形式那样的“影响力”，这可能会限制其在和解工作中的功效。

## *Time Commitment*

## *时间投入*

Much of the playback theatre training described in this paper has developed as the result of a commitment to building relationships over time, on-going learning by the performers and ongoing refinement of teaching practice. This is illustrated by the work conducted in India:

本文介绍的许多一人一故事剧场培训都是长期致力于建立关系、演员不断学习和教学实践不断完善的结果。在印度开展的工作就说明了这一点：

Bev comments: *“The fact that we visited more than once was very meaningful to the groups we worked with. It substantially strengthened the relationships and the level of trust. We were very surprised and honored that they would share such personal and painful stories with us.”*

贝芙评论道：“我们不止一次地访问，这对与我们合作的团体来说意义非凡。这大大加强了双方的关系和信任度。我们对他们愿意与我们分享如此私人和痛苦的故事感到非常惊讶和荣幸”。

*“Going back a second time, we could address difficulties that had arisen using playback theatre in their particular context. For example, different groups had been doing one-off performances that they felt had a limited value for social change. We worked with them to develop thinking about a project approach that involved a series of performances where they could build a relationship with some groups, organizations or villages over time. As a good level of trust developed, more challenging, painful and difficult-to-tell stories could be told.”*

*“回到第二次，我们可以解决在特定环境下使用一人一故事剧场时出现的困难。例如，不同的团体一直在进行一次性表演，他们认为这种演出对社会变革的价值有限。我们与他们合作，对项目方法进行了思考，其中包括一系列演出，他们可以在一段时间内与一些团体、组织或村庄建立联系。随着信任度的提高，更多具有挑战性、痛苦和难以启齿的故事就可以被讲述出来”。*

The work in other settings has built over several years and has always involved workshops of several days duration. Generally the climate that can be built in a group living and training together over several days contrasts dramatically with the climate which can be developed in a one-off playback theatre performance of 1-2 hours duration. An exception to this is the performance for the victims of torture in India where very deep and intense stories were shared in the context of limited relationships with the performing group.

在其他环境中开展的工作历时数年，每次都是为期数天的工作坊。一般来说，在一个团体中共同生活和训练数日所能形成的氛围，与在持续 1-2 小时的一次性一人一故事剧场演出中所能形成的氛围形成鲜明对比。为印度酷刑受害者进行的演出是一个例外，在与演出团体关系有限的情况下，他们分享了非常深刻和激烈的故事。

Similarly, the New Zealand Summer School has developed over six years with intensive planning, input and review by the leaders. The annual event involves an investment of 10 workshop days for the participants. It is over such a sizeable time frame that the work, such as that described in the section on social dialogue, is able to unfold as it does.

同样，新西兰暑期学校经过六年的发展，带领者进行了深入的规划、投入和审查。每年的活动都要投入 10 天时间为学员举办工作坊。正是在如此长的时间框架内，社会对话等工作才得以如期开展。

## *Working across Cultural Differences*

## *跨越文化差异开展工作*

There can be significant challenges in conducting playback theatre across cultural differences when the performers are from a different culture than the audience.

当演员与观众来自不同的文化背景时，进行跨文化差异的戏剧演出会面临巨大的挑战。

If the performers have insufficient cultural awareness of those in their audience, the performance can ‘miss’ portraying their experiences in a recognizable way. Important aspects of a culture or situation may not be understood, and there is a risk that the teller's experience may be trivialized.

如果演员对观众的文化认识不足，演出就可能“错过”以可识别的方式描绘他们的经历。文化或情境的重要方面可能不被理解，讲述者的经历也有可能被淡化。

Ignorance of certain cultural norms can cause offence or make a story difficult to watch. However, one of the conventions of playback theatre is that after the story is enacted, the conductor will check in with the teller to see that there has been an accurate enough portrayal of their story. If the conductor can see discomfort in the teller they may invite the teller to offer a correction. This can be done during a performance to help address this issue. In a longer workshop setting, these gaps in understanding can be corrected, worked with, and wonderful learning can occur. In this way the training together also builds greater understanding across differences and across cultures.

不了解某些文化规范可能会冒犯他人或使故事难以观看。不过，一人一故事剧场的惯例之一是，在故事表演结束后，领航员会与讲述者进行交流，以了解故事是否得到了足够准确的描述。如果领航员发现讲述者有不妥之处，他们会邀请讲述者进行纠正。这可以在表演过程中进行，以帮助解决这一问题。在时间较长的工作坊中，这些理解上的差距可以得到纠正和解决，并产生美妙的学习效果。通过这种共同培训的方式，还可以建立跨越差异和文化的更大理解。

It is striking that playback theatre is now being used in many countries with little need for alteration to its basic structure and form which is simple and clear. It appears to be able to incorporate elements from different cultures without losing any of its power. An example of this is in New Zealand where, on a number of occasions, traditional Maori protocol has been an integral part of playback theatre events and has added considerable depth and meaning to the experience.

令人吃惊的是，现在许多国家都在使用一人一故事剧场，而对其简单明了的基本结构和形式却几乎无需改动。它似乎能够融入不同文化的元素而不失其威力。新西兰就是一个例子，在那里，传统的毛利礼仪多次成为一人一故事剧场活动的一个组成部分，并为这种体验增添了相当的深度和意义。

Within the form itself, performers can use their own language and there is plenty of room for variation in aesthetics, and modes of expression. For example, in India fabric is used primarily to assist with characterization while the Japanese use fabric for creating metaphor or essence. In Kiribati the performers were encouraged to incorporate singing, which was a highly developed ability in that culture. Increasing the number of musicians brought the role of musician to life in that cultural context.

在这种形式中，演员可以使用自己的语言，在美学和表达方式上有很大的变化空间。例如，在印度，布料主要用于帮助塑造人物形象，而日本人则用布料来创造隐喻或本质。在基里巴斯，人们鼓励演员将歌唱融入其中，因为歌唱在当地文化中是一种高度发达的能力。乐师人数的增加使乐师的角色在该文化背景下变得更加生动。

In certain cross-cultural contexts, it may be necessary to create particular conditions that will encourage some tellers to bring forward their stories. In a training workshop in New Zealand, a small group of Maori women asked if playback theatre could be adapted so they could feel more confident to tell their stories:

在某些跨文化背景下，可能有必要创造特殊条件，鼓励一些讲述者讲述自己的故事。在新西兰的一个培训工作坊上，一小群毛利妇女询问是否可以对一人一故事剧场进行改编，这样她们就能更自信地讲述自己的故事：

*“They asked if they could choose the actors for their stories from the audience rather than having to choose from a group of actors already on stage. They wanted to have the freedom to choose the actors who they most trusted to capture their world. The leaders and the group willingly accepted this to make it easier for these women to tell their stories. A very deep and powerful story of cruelty, dispossession and loss was told by one of the Maori women and enacted beautifully and respectfully by the two other Maori women and those Pakeha actors who were chosen”. Bev comments, “In my experience it is very uncommon for such a story to be told in a mixed group in New Zealand. The Summer School is the other place I have seen that happen.”*

*“他们询问是否可以从观众中选择故事的演员，而不是从已经在舞台上的一群演员中进行选择。她们希望能够自由选择她们最信任的演员来记录她们的世界。为了让这些妇女更容易讲述她们的故事，领导和小组成员都欣然接受了这一要求。其中一名毛利妇女讲述了一个关于残酷、剥夺和损失的深刻而有力的故事，另外两名毛利妇女和那些被选中的 Pakeha 族演员将这个故事演绎得十分精彩，令人肃然起敬”。Bev 评论说：“根据我的经验，在新西兰，这样一个故事在混合团体中讲述是非常罕见的。暑期班是我见过这种情况的另一个地方。”*

Reaching across cultural differences can be very demanding when the performers are from a dominant culture and the audience or teller is from a group which has suffered oppression from that group. People from marginalized or oppressed sub-groups may prefer to tell their stories in their own language and to be able to identify themselves with the actors on stage rather than have their experience mediated by the mainstream culture/oppressing group. This is especially important when trust between cultural groups is minimal. For example, in one playback theatre performance in New Zealand a Maori participant did not want to choose Pakeha actors to play the part of him or his ancestors, as his experience of historical and current injustices was too strong and immediate to be set aside.

如果演员来自主流文化，而观众或讲述者来自遭受主流文化压迫的群体，那么跨越文化差异就会非常困难。来自边缘化或受压迫亚群体的人们可能更愿意用自己的语言讲述自己的故事，并能够认同舞台上的演员，而不是让主流文化/施加压迫的群体来调解他们的经历。当文化群体之间的信任度极低时，这一点尤为重要。例如，在新西兰的一次一人一故事剧场演出中，一位毛利参与者不愿意选择 Pakeha 族演员来扮演他或他的祖先，因为他对历史和当前不公正现象的体验太强烈、太直接了，不能被搁置一旁。

In contrast, at times the challenges of a deep cultural divide between the performers and the audience has been overcome. For example, members of the Fijian Indian community were very moved to see their stories of being discriminated against and attackedunderstood and enacted so fully by the WAC performing group which comprised five indigenous Fijians (the perpetrating group) and one European.

与此相反，演员与观众之间深层次的文化隔阂有时也会被克服。例如，斐济印度裔社区的成员看到他们遭受歧视和攻击的故事被由五名土著斐济人（施暴群体）和一名欧洲人组成的 WAC 演出团体充分理解和演绎，非常感动。

Conducting playback theatre events with mixed language groups within a particular society also poses challenges. For example, at a playback theatre event in southern India in 2004, the participants from three language groups had no common language they all felt at ease with<sup>17</sup>. The group's strong commitment to inclusion meant that for four days all instructions, stories and presentations were translated into Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and English. This was done using interpreters from the group and without the assistance of modern technology. The level of goodwill and patience with this process was remarkable. At times artistic elements of performance were compromised by the slower pace and loss of flow. However, the value of ensuring that everyone could tell stories and be listened to, and the strong sense of community that resulted, more than made up for this.

在一个特定社会中，为混合语言群体举办戏剧演出活动也会带来挑战。例如，2004 年在印度南部举行的一次一人一故事剧场活动中，来自三个语言群体的参与者没有共同的语言，他们都觉得很自在<sup>17</sup>。该团体坚定地致力于包容，这意味着在四天的时间里，所有的说明、故事和演讲都被翻译成泰米尔语、坎纳达语、泰卢固语和英语。翻译工作是在没有现代技术辅助的情况下，由小组中的翻译人员完成的。在这一过程中，大家表现出了极大的诚意和耐心。有时，演出的艺术元素会因慢节奏和不流畅而受到影响。然而，确保每个人都能讲述故事并被倾听的价值以及由此产生的强烈的社区意识足以弥补这一点。

17 In India people in different states speak different languages. While it is compulsory to learn Hindi at school this is not a language of choice.

17 在印度，不同邦的人讲不同的语言。虽然在学校必须学习印地语，但这并不是一门大家自主选择的语言。

## *Risks of Secondary Dramatization*

## *二次戏剧化的风险*

At playback theatre performances held in communities where people have suffered from racism, ethnic violence and civil war, traumatic stories are likely to be told. These stories can be deeply distressing to the performers and working with them is challenging for even the most experienced practitioners. Taking on some roles and entering the experience of the other can affect the performers profoundly. Playback theatre companies often find they need to take time with each other immediately after, and in the period following performances, to share their responses to having heard and performed these stories. It is also important that members of performing groups take opportunities to tell their own stories during their regular rehearsals.

在遭受过种族主义、种族暴力和内战的社区举行的一人一故事剧场演出中，很可能会讲述一些创伤性的故事。这些故事可能会让演员深感痛苦，即使是最有经验的演员，与这些故事打交道也是一项挑战。扮演某些角色并进入他人的经历会对演员产生深远的影响。一人一故事剧团经常发现，他们需要在演出结束后的当下和演出后的一段时间内花时间相互交流，分享他们听到和表演这些故事后的反应。同样重要的是，演出团队的成员在平时排练时也要抓住机会讲述自己的故事。

When performers have themselves experienced traumatic life events, their enactment of disturbing stories in playback theatre can pose a risk to their emotional wellbeing. For example, it became apparent for the WAC group in Fiji, that their playback theatre work sometimes surfaced memories of trauma from their own lives that had only partially been resolved. Regular group sessions with an outside facilitator were recommended to help the group de-brief after listening to and working with difficult stories. Individual counseling sessions as a safe, confidential and productive means of working with these issues were also recommended. The unavailability of this kind of support for group members produced an ongoing high level of stress in the life of the group and at times contributed to some members deciding to leave. More recently the group has received considerable assistance with the issue of secondary dramatization and has invested time and care into their own healing processes.

当演员自身经历过创伤性的生活事件时，他们在一人一故事剧场中演出的令人不安的故事可能会对他们的情感健康构成威胁。例如，斐济的 WAC 小组发现，他们的一人一故事剧场作品有时会浮现出他们自己生活中的创伤记忆，而这些记忆只得到了部分解决。他们建议定期与外部主持人举行小组会议，以帮助小组在聆听和处理困难的故事后消除忧虑。此外，还建议将个人咨询作为解决这些问题的一种安全、保密和富有成效的方法。由于小组成员得不到这种支持，小组的生活一直处于高度紧张状态，有时甚至导致一些成员决定离开。最近，该小组在二次戏剧化问题上得到了大量援助，并投入时间和精力进行自我康复。

Similarly in Angola, the non-government organization which initiated the playback theatre training was aware of the dangers of secondary dramatization. They decided not to continue the playback theatre work because of the intensity of the stories and the lack of psychological and emotional support for the group.

同样，在安哥拉，发起一人一故事剧场培训的非政府组织也意识到了二次戏剧化的危险。他们决定不再继续开展一人一故事剧场工作，因为故事太激烈，而且缺乏对该群体的心理和情感支持。

## *Levels of Competency*

## *能力水平*

The practitioners portrayed in this chapter are very experienced and highly competent in their field. Bev Hosking, Christian Penny and Mary Good all trained in drama, psychodrama and playback theatre. Bev and Mary work respectively, as a counselor and psychotherapist. All three have performed in Playback Theatre companies. Mary and Bev have both founded and directed playback theatre companies. All have been involved in training people in other playback theatre companies. The maturity of the leadership they provide is considerable. The number of invitations to run playback theatre training in different countries of the world is an indication of how their experience and set of abilities is valued.

本章中描述的实践者在各自领域都非常有经验和能力。Bev Hosking、Christian Penny 和 Mary Good 都接受过戏剧、心理剧和一人一故事剧场的培训。贝芙和玛丽分别是心理咨询师和心理治疗师。三人都曾在一人一故事剧团演出过。玛丽和贝芙都曾创办和指导过一人一故事剧团。三人都参与过其他一人一故事剧团的人员培训。她们的带领能力相当成熟。她们受邀在世界不同国家举办一人一故事剧场培训的次数之多，足以说明她们的经验和能力受到了多大的重视。

There are many component skills in playback theatre, including performance and conducting skills. Other abilities underpinning the work profiled here include group work skills, a high level of spontaneity, the capacity to help others learn, a deep appreciation for cultural differences, a strong vision for what playback theatre can bring forth and the personal qualities and interpersonal strengths to realize that vision. These abilities have been developed over a number of decades and do not come easily, as many an aspiring conductor or playback theatre company director can attest.

一人一故事剧场包含了很多技能，包括表演和领航员技能。其他能力还包括团队合作技能、高度的自发性、帮助他人学习的能力、对文化差异的深刻理解、对一人一故事剧场所能带来的影响的强烈愿景，以及实现这一愿景所需的个人素质和人际交往能力。这些能力都是经过数十年的发展而形成的，来之不易，许多有抱负的领航员或一人一故事剧团导演都可以证明这一点。

It is important to note that not all playback theatre practitioners are motivated by the same interests. Some are more oriented to providing entertainment, with a primary focus on the artistic elements in theatre and music, while others are oriented to storytelling as a form of individual therapy. Even where there is an interest in addressing social issues, practitioners express realistic apprehensions about how to handle the complexity and responsibility of this work and their own emotional response to it. These are important ethical considerations relevant to all playback theatre practitioners.

值得注意的是，并非所有一人一故事剧场实践者都出于同样的兴趣。一些人更倾向于提供娱乐，主要关注戏剧和音乐中的艺术元素，而另一些人则倾向于将讲故事作为一种个人治疗方式。即使是对解决社会问题感兴趣的实践者，也会对如何处理这项工作的复杂性和责任感以及自己的情绪反应表示现实的担忧。这些都是与所有一人一故事剧场实践者相关的重要伦理考虑因素。

# Conclusions

# 结论

Playback theatre originated in the USA nearly 30 years ago. Since then it has been readily adopted in a wide range of cultural settings. Most of this development has happened through the efforts of local performers stimulated by input from visiting teachers and also by cultural exchange at international training and conferences.

近 30 年前，一人一故事剧场起源于美国。从那时起，它就被广泛地应用于各种文化环境中。这种发展主要是通过当地演员的努力，在客座教师的启发下，以及通过国际培训和会议的文化交流实现的。

This form of theatre aims to hear and play back the stories of ordinary people. It enables many things to happen at once, including storytelling, artistic performance and engagement as a community. This engagement includes at times simply meeting each other; telling and learning of each other's experiences; having these mirrored back; and experiencing and expressing the range of feelings related to these experiences.

这种戏剧形式旨在聆听和回演普通人的故事。它使许多事情同时发生，包括讲故事、艺术表演和社区参与。这种参与有时包括简单的相互见面；讲述和学习彼此的经历；将这些经历反映出来；以及体验和表达与这些经历相关的各种感受。

The extent to which playback theatre is used for simple entertainment, dramatic satisfaction, individual therapy or community building varies, depending on the interests and abilities of those in the performing groups. The illustrations presented in this paper particularly amplify how playback theatre has been applied to foster social development and social repair, which is relevant to its application in reconciliation.

一人一故事剧场在简单娱乐、戏剧满足、个人治疗或社区建设方面的应用程度各不相同，这取决于演出团队成员的兴趣和能力。本文中介绍的例子特别强调了一人一故事剧场如何用于促进社会发展和社会修复，这与一人一故事剧场在和解中的应用相关。

Playback theatre offers a creative option for reconciliation efforts. It opens up a safe, reflective and creative communal space for engagement between neighbors and fellow citizens. It adopts an open-minded approach that engages a group or community with their own current concerns.

一人一故事剧场为和解努力提供了一种创造性的选项。它为邻里和同胞之间的交往开辟了一个安全、反思和创造性的公共空间。它采用一种开放的方式，让一个群体或社区参与到他们当前所关注的问题中来。

While it is not agenda-driven and it does not aim to deliver a certain message, it does demonstrate particular attitudes to life which are relevant to reconciliation. These include open inquiry, respect for humanity and engagement with a wide range of people and perspectives.

虽然它不以议程为导向，也不以传递某种信息为目的，但它确实展示了与和解相关的特定生活态度。这些态度包括开放式探究、尊重人性以及与广泛的人和观点接触。

In this paper we have illustrated what playback theatre can bring to reconciliation efforts. It helps communities build relationships, process difficult events and engage in a deep dialogue about areas of concern. It has group therapeutic effects in breaking down isolation, allowing for the expression and recognition of deep feelings and generating new understanding between people and fresh perspectives on difficult situations. It can be used to explore community concerns directly and indirectly, with a focus on the past, the present, the future and the ‘here and now’ experience of the audience.

在本文中，我们说明了一人一故事剧场能为和解工作带来什么。它有助于社区建立关系，处理困难事件，并就关切领域进行深入对话。它在打破孤立、允许表达和承认深厚感情、在人与人之间产生新的理解和对困难情况的新看法方面具有群体治疗作用。它可用于直接或间接地探讨社区关注的问题，重点关注过去、现在、未来以及受众的“此时此地”体验。

Participation in playback theatre training develops a range of values and abilities relevant to reconciliation, including attentive listening, entering into the world of the other, empathy, spontaneity, flexibility and group leadership. Exposure to these capacities over time is likely to have a positive modeling affect on audiences.

参与一人一故事剧场培训可以培养一系列与和解相关的价值观和能力，包括专注倾听、进入他人的世界、同理心、自发性、灵活性和团体领导力。长期接触这些能力可能会对观众产生积极的示范影响。

Playback theatre can increase cross-cultural understanding and bring about social repair as audience members see their experiences recognized and portrayed accurately and sensitively by those from ethnic or social groups from whom they have been alienated.

当观众看到他们的经历被那些与他们疏远的种族或社会群体的人准确而敏感地认可和描述时，一人一故事剧场可以增进跨文化理解并带来社会修复。

However, playback theatre has some inherent limitations. It cannot reach a mass audience as can community radio or large music concerts, for example. When used to explore the experiences of people in divided communities the cultural origins of the performers can create obstacles and blind spots. It is still relatively untested in most settings as a way of working directly with combined audiences of ethnic or social groups deeply alienated from each other or in significant conflict.

然而，一人一故事剧场有一些固有的局限性。例如，它无法像社区广播或大型音乐会那样覆盖广大受众。当用于探索分裂社区中人们的经历时，演员的文化背景可能会造成障碍和盲点。在大多数情况下，要想直接与那些彼此严重疏远或存在严重冲突的种族或社会群体的联合观众合作，这种方法相对来说还没有得到验证。

But when it comes to reconciliation, some of playback theatre's limitations are also its strengths. Development of the abilities to lead and perform playback theatre to explore deep group concerns requires considerable investment of time, care and skill. The outcomes described in this paper are not easily replicated in short-term work or by less experienced practitioners. Similarly, the working relationships between members of performing troupes and their audiences require significant commitment.

但是，就和解而言，一人一故事剧场的某些局限性也是其优势所在。培养带领和表演一人一故事剧场的能力，以探讨深层次的群体问题，需要投入大量的时间、细心和技巧。本文所描述的成果不容易在短期工作中或由经验较少的实践者复制。同样，剧团成员与观众之间的工作关系也需要大量的投入。

Playback theatre is a creative resource for community-building which produces outcomes highly relevant to reconciliation. Because of the complexity of reconciliation work, we recommend it is conducted by experienced practitioners, with the group leadership skills described in this paper. We also recommend that the timing and appropriateness of its use is assessed in collaboration with colleagues from peace-building and community-building agencies, so that playback theatre can take its place in a range of coordinated reconciliation initiatives.

一人一故事剧场是社区建设的一种创造性资源，其成果与和解高度相关。由于和解工作的复杂性，我们建议由经验丰富的实践者来开展这项工作，他们应具备本文所述的团体领导技能。我们还建议与和平建设机构和社区建设机构的同事合作，评估使用该方法的时机和适宜性，以便一人一故事剧场能够在一系列协调的和解行动中占据一席之地。

Establishing the strong relationships and the range of capabilities to do this work well are essential conditions for using playback theatre in reconciliation and fulfilling the promise it holds.

建立稳固的关系和各种能力以做好这项工作，是利用一人一故事剧场实现和解和履行其承诺的必要条件。

Appendix 1: Highlights of Playback Theatre Training

附录 1：一人一故事剧场培训要点

The field research for this paper involved documentation of the New Zealand Playback Theatre Summer School held in January 2004. Elements of the School are highlighted here to give the reader an insight into how this playback theatre training is conducted and some of the essential factors involved in its success.

本文的实地研究包括记录 2004 年 1 月举办的新西兰一人一故事剧场暑期学校。本文重点介绍了该学校的一些内容，以便读者深入了解这种一人一故事剧场培训是如何进行的，以及取得成功的一些重要因素。

## *Play: An Essential Ingredient*

## *游戏：不可或缺的要素*

The Summer School involves a lot of play and laughter, things not readily associated with the serious business of social dialogue and reconciliation. While the play helps the performers warm up physically, it aims for much more: to develop the abilities essential for good improvisational theatre.

暑期班少不了游戏和欢声笑语，这些东西与严肃的社会对话与和解工作并不容易联系在一起。虽然戏剧有助于演员进行身体热身，但它的目的远不止于此：培养优秀的即兴戏剧所必需的能力。

Games of musical chairs, catch, the winking game (moving around the room winking at everyone you pass) and hug tag (you hug another person to be ‘saved’ from being tagged) are building the performers‟ capacities for immediacy and alertness to each other in the ‘here and now’. Shyness and inhibitions about meeting and touching new people are overcome. As group members are thrown together in new combinations, their reliance on the comfort of their familiar subgroup is eroded in favor of easy participation with an ever-changing set of fellow performers.

音乐椅游戏、接球游戏、眨眼游戏（在房间里四处走动，向经过的每个人眨眼）和拥抱标记游戏（你拥抱另一个人，以“拯救”自己不被标记）都在培养演员在“此时此地”的即时性和对彼此的警觉性。与新朋友见面和接触时的害羞和拘束感得以克服。当小组成员以新的组合形式出现在一起时，他们对自己熟悉的小团体的依赖性就会减弱，从而更容易融入到不断变化的演员阵容中去。

Playful activities are interspersed with vocal warm-ups, vocal improvisations in pairs, Maori songs (waiata), Maori stick games (which involve singing and throwing in unison), physical stretches, loosening each other up through massage, and slowly moving around in pairs giving and taking each other's weight. As they play there is growing physical and emotional ease and greater expressiveness.

在游戏活动中穿插声乐热身、两人一组的声乐即兴表演、毛利歌曲（waiata）、毛利棍子游戏（包括齐声歌唱和投掷）、身体拉伸、通过按摩放松彼此，以及两两一组慢慢地移动，互相给予和承受对方的重量。在玩耍的过程中，他们的身体和情感都变得越来越轻松，表达能力也越来越强。

Some games clearly hone the performers‟ abilities to improvise. For example, performers are invited to pair up to play the ‘yes…and’ game, demonstrated first by Bev and Christian:

有些游戏明显锻炼了演员的即兴发挥能力。例如，演员被邀请配对玩“是......和”游戏，贝芙和克里斯蒂安首先进行了演示：

Christian is making the physical motions of digging a hole.

克里斯蒂安正在做挖洞的身体动作。

Bev: “That's a great hole!”

贝芙：“这个洞真棒！”

Christian: “Yes, I'm building a washing line for my family!” Bev: “I imagine it will be a long one.”

克里斯蒂安：“是的，我要为我的家人建一条洗衣线！”贝芙：“我猜它会很长。”

Christian: “Yes and it will catch the North sun.”

克里斯琴：“是的，它能捕捉到北国的阳光。”

Bev: “I bet Katherine is really pleased about that!”

贝芙：“我打赌凯瑟琳一定很高兴！”

Christian: Yes, she's so pleased she is taking me out to dinner.” Bev: No doubt you will be on your best behavior.”

克里斯蒂安：是的，她很高兴，要请我吃饭。贝芙：毫无疑问，你会表现得最好。”

Christian: Yes, and I will have a present for her.”

克里斯琴：是的，我会为她准备一份礼物。

While they play this game the performers have varying flow and ease in responding immediately to keep generating a ‘story’ together, which has life, movement and coherence.

在玩游戏的过程中，演员们的动作流畅自如，并能立即做出反应，从而不断创造出一个个“故事”，这些“故事”具有生命力、动感和连贯性。

As they play, saying yes to someone else's initiative involves accepting being taken into new unknown territory. This process builds courage and daring in the face of not-knowing.

正如他们所玩的游戏一样，对别人的倡议说“是”意味着接受被带入未知的新领域。这个过程可以培养面对未知的勇气和胆量。

Of the two workshop leaders, it is Christian who leads these activities at the Summer School and he does so with a distinctive personal authority both nurturing and provocative. At the nurturing end of the spectrum, he introduces a game by asking: “R., did you play musical chairs when you were a child?” After the first round of the game he encourages participants to voice what he has seen them portray: “As you farewell your first dance partner, you say: ‘I was a little bit shy, but I felt supported by you’”. And after the second dance partner “You know, magically with you I feel even more confident”.

在暑期学校的这些活动中，由克里斯蒂安担任两个工作坊的负责人，他以一种独特的个人权威，既有鼓励性，又有煽动性。在鼓励性方面，他在介绍一个游戏时问道：“R，你小时候玩过音乐椅吗？”第一轮游戏结束后，他鼓励参与者说出他所看到的他们的形象：“当你告别你的第一个舞伴时，你说：‘我有点害羞，但我感觉到了你的支持’”。而在第二个舞伴之后，“你知道吗，神奇的是，和你在一起，我感觉更加自信了”。

At his more provocative, Christian flouts political correctness and sentimentality. He is playing too.

克里斯蒂安的演绎更具煽动性，他蔑视政治正确和多愁善感。他具有玩耍的精神。

He asks the group: “When you think of dancing, who looks like a good partner?” Someone replies “You!” He responds: “You can't have me; otherwise other people will be jealous. it's not good to make the Japanese jealous!”

他问大家“当你想到跳舞时，谁看起来像个好舞伴？”有人回答：“你！”他回答说“你不能拥有我，否则其他人会嫉妒的。 让日本人嫉妒可不好！”

Participants in competitive dancing games are teased: “You used to be so good last Summer School, S., but G. wasn't there then!” and “This is a warning A., you can be eliminated for being too boring!” “G. you have been eliminated for doing a turkey!” When the last two contenders in a game of musical chairs avoid sitting in the chair to make one the winner and the other the loser, he teases them warmly about their politeness.

参加舞蹈竞技比赛的人被取笑：“去年暑期班你跳得很好，S 但G 当时不在！”，“这是一个警告，A 你会因为太无聊而被淘汰！”“G，你因为做火鸡被淘汰了！”当音乐椅游戏中的最后两名竞争者为了让一个成为赢家，另一个成为输家而避免坐在椅子上时，他会热情地取笑他们的礼貌。

This provocative teasing is tempered with an eye for workable norms about physical safety. “Be careful, E. (a North American), if you are with someone from Australasia. We are mad for rugby and we run for the chair!” And to the group: “If you push or elbow I will send you off!”

这种煽动性的调侃，同时也照顾到了人身安全的可行规范。“小心点，E（北美人），如果你和来自的人在一起。我们为橄榄球而疯狂，我们为椅子而奔跑！“对大家说”如果你推人或肘击，我就把你送走！”

Each game is a simulation of sorts, developing key abilities needed on the stage in improvisational theatre including expressiveness, un-self-consciousness, accepting and building on ‘offers’ by other performers, being attuned to the whole group, responsiveness and daring.

每个游戏都是一种模拟，培养即兴剧场舞台上所需的关键能力，包括表现力、无我意识、接受和基于其他演员的“提议”来创造、与整个团体保持一致、反应能力和胆量。

Games of increasing difficulty are played as the School progresses including a trust game with all participants running around until, during a time designated by Christian, one of them decides to fall and the others have to immediately move to catch him/her. This requires the faller to make a clear ‘offer’ and to create a space before they fall and it requires the catchers to move towards a fall as soon as they sense it happening. This requires the high caliber attentiveness of the Playback ensemble performing on stage.

随着学校活动的开展，游戏的难度也在增加，其中包括一个信任游戏，所有参加者在游戏中跑来跑去，直到在克里斯蒂安指定的时间内，其中一人决定摔倒，其他人必须立即去接住他/她。这就要求摔倒者在摔倒前发出明确的“邀约”，并创造一个空间，并且要求接住者在感觉到摔倒时立即向摔倒者移动。这就要求一人一故事剧团在舞台上演出具有高度的专注力。

Towards the end of the Summer School an extraordinary game of skipping takes place. Individuals are invited to skip through a large rope turned by Bev and Christian. Then pairs are invited to skip through together. By the end of the game the group is skipping as a large group of 16, which takes considerable spontaneous co-ordination!

在暑期班即将结束时，举行了一场别开生面的跳绳游戏。个人受邀跳过由贝芙和克里斯蒂安转动的大绳。然后邀请两人一起跳过。游戏结束时，16 个人组成了一个大的跳绳小组，这需要相当强的自发协调能力！

The link between play and improvisation skills is apparent as the Summer School progresses. As you might expect, the quality of performing increases significantly over the ten days. But it seems to have more to do with a significant shift in the individuals than mere skills training, playful as it is. The people who came to this workshop look transformed at the end. They look much more alive, engaged with each other and they have a ‘glow’ on.

随着暑期班的深入，表演和即兴技巧之间的联系显而易见。正如大家所预料的那样，在这十天里，演出的质量有了显著提高。但这似乎更多地与个人的重大转变有关，而不是单纯的技能培训，尽管它很好玩。参加这个工作坊的人最后都脱胎换骨了。他们看起来更有活力了，相互之间更投入了，身上也焕发出了“光彩”。

It is here that the spontaneity effect familiar to those who have participated in psychodrama or spontaneity training is evident. Both leaders are trained in psychodrama a group psychotherapy method originated by Jacob Levy Moreno (1889-1974).<sup>18</sup> It is clear that the emphasis on play at the Summer School is not just an instrumental skill-building process. Rather, it reflects a commitment to the development of spontaneity – in the individuals and in the functioning of the whole group.

参加过心理剧或自发性培训的人所熟悉的自发性效应就在这里显现出来。两位带领者都接受过心理剧的培训，心理剧是雅各布-列维-莫雷诺（1889-1974）提出的一种团体心理治疗方法<sup>18</sup>。很明显，暑期班对游戏的强调不仅仅是一个工具性的技能培养过程，而是反映了对发展自发性的重视--无论是在个人身上还是在整个团体的运作中。

18 Jonathan Fox has edited a book of Moreno’s selected writings: *The Essential Moreno: Writings on Psychodrama, Group Method and Spontaneity* (1987)

18 乔纳森-福克斯编辑了一本《莫雷诺文选》：The Essential Moreno：关于心理剧、团体方法和自发性的著作》（1987）。

Defined from a psychodramatic perspective, spontaneity goes well beyond its street meaning as somewhat free-wheeling, impulsive behavior. Elements of spontaneity valued in psychodrama include adequacy, warming up, vitality, originality, the ability to move between reality and fantasy and back again, and creativity.

从心理剧的角度来定义，自发性远远超出了对它庸俗的理解，即有些自由散漫、冲动的行为。心理剧所重视的自发性要素包括充分性、预热、活力、独创性、在现实与幻想之间来回穿梭的能力以及创造性。

To illustrate two of these: *adequacy* is the form of spontaneity which enables individuals to adapt, move and respond flexibly to new situations. And the ability to *warm up* to the roles required in particular situations – to the appropriate thinking, feeling and actions – is also a form of spontaneity. If we enter into a situation ‘cold’ we do not function adequately. When we ‘warm up’ fully to a particular moment in a particular situation, then we are said to be in a spontaneity state. In this state the creative genius awakens, allowing new perceptions and new solutions to emerge into our consciousness (Clayton 1989: 67-68).

举例子来说明这两者：*适切*是一种自发性，它使个人能够适应、调整和灵活地应对新情况。而在特定情况下给所需的角色--适当的思维、感觉和行动--*预热*的能力也是一种自发性的体现。如果我们“冷冰冰”地进入一个情境中，我们就无法适切地发挥自我。当我们完全“预热”到特定情境中的特定时刻时，我们就处于自发状态。在这种状态下，天才的创造力会被唤醒，新的认知和新的解决方案会出现在我们的意识中（Clayton 1989: 67-68）。

## *Building an Open Group Culture*

## 建设开放式的团队文化

The Summer School is quite a journey for the participants. In the workshop there are periods of arriving, catching up with themselves and presenting themselves to others. They bring forward their own experiences and stories and listen and respond to those of others. All the while they are doing the groundwork as performers, putting themselves forward to perform and being coached on their work. By journey's end there is a strong sense of both personal accomplishment and social relationship. Participants comment that they could not have achieved what they have without being ‘held’ by the others. These comments, made with feeling, are not sentimental. They reflect something of the distinctive group culture built here.

暑期班对学员来说是一次相当漫长的旅程。在工作坊中，学员们既要到达目的地，又要了解自己，还要向他人展示自己。他们将自己的经历和故事呈现出来，并倾听和回应他人的经历和故事。与此同时，他们也在做演员的基础工作，让自己参与表演，并接受工作指导。旅程结束时，个人成就感和社会关系感都非常强烈。学员们表示，如果没有其他人的“帮助”，他们不可能取得现在的成就。这些感慨并非感情用事。它们反映了在这里建立的独特的群体文化。

One of the foundations of this group culture is *social inclusion.* In pursuit of this outcome, the leaders make a range of interventions.

这种团体文化的基础之一是社会包容。为了实现这一目标，带领者们采取了一系列干预措施。

The group comprises participants from many language groups. In the first introductions, warm-up activities and Playback performing, participants are invited to use their own language whether or not it is understood by others. Rather than causing confusion in the listener it seems to engender a different kind of attentiveness to the person, their body language and their being. In the speaker there is ease, flow, self-acceptance. Different worlds co-exist on stage together as performers play with both understanding and not understanding, knowing and not-knowing.

小组成员来自多个语言群体。在最初的自我介绍、热身活动和一人一故事演出中，参与者被邀请使用自己的语言，无论别人是否能听懂。这非但没有给听者造成困惑，反而使他们对自己、自己的肢体语言和自己的存在产生了一种不同的关注。在演讲者身上，有轻松、流畅和自我接纳。不同的世界在舞台上共存，演员在理解与不理解、知道与不知道之间游走。

In this context, early anxieties about being in a cross-cultural group surface naturally. A Japanese woman is tearful as she says: “I am nervous I can't speak English very well. I will do my best. Please talk to me slowly.” A Chinese woman says: “I feel very small, tiny. I don't know how to place my position in this community. I am nervous how to behave myself. I don't want to disturb the community - I want to watch.”

在这种情况下，早期对跨文化群体的焦虑自然而然地浮现出来。一位日本妇女泪流满面地说：“我很紧张，因为我的英语说得不好。我会尽力的。请慢慢跟我说。一位中国妇女说：”我觉得自己很渺小。我不知道如何定位自己在这个社区中的位置。我很紧张，不知道该如何表现自己。我不想打扰这个社区--我想在一旁观看”。

Early attention is also paid to linking participants up with a wide range of people in the group. This prevents the formation of comfortable cliques or language sub-groups.

此外，还及早注意将学员与小组中的各类人员联系起来。这可以防止形成舒适的小团体或语言分组。

Participants are encouraged to keep working with others they don't know or know least well. As teams form for performance, Bev notices some participants are less confident to put themselves forward. “Let's have five actors and a musician for a story, including at least one person from Japan.” Later she reflects privately: “Some of the Japanese are only here for a few days. Also because of the language, it is harder and harder for them to get up if they leave it (until later).”

我们鼓励学员继续与其他不认识或不太熟悉的人合作。在组建演出团队时，贝芙注意到有些学员不太敢展示自己。“让我们请五位演员和一位乐师来演绎一个故事，其中至少有一位来自日本”。后来她私下里反思道：“有些日本人只来几天。另外，由于语言的原因，如果（等到以后）再让他们站起来，他们就会越来越难”。

Later the needs of non-English speakers to understand the stories as they are told in English to the conductor are addressed. Bev, to the performers: “Let's make sure if you do not understand the story that you indicate during the telling. In a training setting like this, that is fine.” Christian: “Practice putting up your hand”. Later a Chinese participant says “I have many things I want to talk about. I'm naturally talkative but in English I have many hesitations. I am afraid of being clumsy.” Bev responds thanking her and saying, “We will work to create an atmosphere where you can find the space to express yourself. I don't think anyone will be impatient with you. We will lose out if we do not hear from you. I know what it is like trying to speak another language. Sometimes I have felt like a four year old.”

随后，还讨论了非英语国家的人在听领航员用英语讲述故事时理解故事的需要。贝芙对演员说“让我们确保，如果你听不懂故事，你可以在讲述过程中表示出来。在这样的培训环境中，这样做是没有问题的。”克里斯蒂安：“练习举手”。后来，一位中国学员说：“我有很多话想说。我天生就很健谈，但说英语时我有很多犹豫。我害怕笨手笨脚”。贝芙对她表示感谢，并说：“我们会努力创造一种氛围，让你找到表达自己的空间。我想没有人会对你不耐烦。如果没有你的消息，我们会很失落。我知道尝试说另一种语言的感觉。有时我觉得自己就像一个四岁的孩子”。

As a conductor, Bev is keenly attentive to who comes forward to tell. After the performance of a fluid sculpture she may ask, “Who is having a different experience?” or “What is not being said? What is hard to bring forward now?” “Let's hear from one of you who doesn't have English as a first language.” She achieves a delicate balance, actively including people by creating an invitation or opening for them to come forward, without generating pressure.

作为一名领航员，Bev 非常关注谁来讲述。在流动塑像结束后，她可能会问：“谁有不同的体验？”或“有什么没有说出来？现在有什么难以启齿的？”“让我们听听你们中一位不以英语为母语的人怎么说”。她实现了一种微妙的平衡，通过创造一种邀请或开放的机会，让人们主动站出来，同时又不产生压力。

In this culture a high level of *self acceptance* and *mutual acceptance* becomes apparent. Individuals are consistently encouraged to notice their own experiences moment to moment: experiences of arriving, leaving their lives behind, sharing accommodation, and at each phase of the work together. The highs and lows and nuances of life at the Summer School are regularly shared, listened to and reflected back to participants in short enactments such as fluid sculptures and ‘pairs’ which portray both sides of a conflict simultaneously. The group displays ease with this level of self-awareness and self-expression – it is clearly the stuff of company rehearsal time. As is the attentive listening to each others‟ ‘moments’, ‘conflicts’ and ‘stories’. A wide range of feelings and experiences are encouraged, expressed and attended to.

在这种文化中，自我接纳和相互接纳的程度很高。我们一直鼓励个人注意自己每时每刻的经历：到达、离开自己的生活、共用食宿以及共同工作每个阶段的经历。学员们定期分享、倾听和反映暑期学校生活中的高低起伏和细微差别，并通过简短的表演，如流动塑像和“一对对”，同时描绘冲突的双方。学员们对这种程度的自我意识和自我表达表现得游刃有余--这显然是剧团排练的内容。在排练过程中，他们认真倾听彼此的“时刻”、“冲突”和“故事”。各种感受和体验都得到了鼓励、表达和关注。

For example on the morning of the third day everyone responds in turn to Bev's question: “What is alive in you?” E. comments: “I am surprised by the power of old stories, old losses. I'm a little exposed. During the last six months I have been travelling, I've had freedom and adventure and I've been alone. Now it's nice to be held within a group and be taken care of.” Later M. comments” I feel peace and I think is this real? Scary things might be coming.” Later T. comments: “I'm floating through lots of different things. I'm tearful a lot and need to rest a lot. I want to go and sleep somewhere if there was a really protected, safe space. I'm not avoiding connection – I just need to look after myself. I'm enjoying the movement and sound. I'm getting feed (by it).”

例如，第三天早上，每个人都依次回答了贝芙的问题：“你体内有什么东西？”E 评论道：“我惊讶于过去的故事、过去的失去中的力量。我有点暴露了。在过去的六个月里，我一直在旅行，我有过自由和冒险，也有过孤独。现在，我很高兴能在一个团队中得到照顾”。后来，M 评论说：“我感到平静，我想这是真的吗？可怕的事情可能就要发生了”。后来 T 评论说“我经历了很多不同的事情。我经常流泪，需要休息。如果有一个真正受保护的安全空间，我想去睡一觉。我并不是在逃避连接--我只是需要照顾好自己。我喜欢运动和声音。我（通过它）得到了滋养”。

This accepting atmosphere is fostered by what the leaders do as well as what they don't do. As the group performs the first story they are out of tune with each other and their performance is a bit chaotic and unrefined. There is a decision not to rework this. Bev comments to Christian later: “I think we won't go back to the first story –it's always hard at the beginning when the relationships are still largely undeveloped and it's such a big thing to put yourself forward”.

带领者的所作所为以及他们没有做的事情都营造了这种接纳的氛围。在演绎第一个故事时，小组成员之间的配合不够默契，表演有点混乱，不够精致。大家决定不再重演它。贝芙后来对克里斯蒂安说“我想我们不会再演第一个故事了--刚开始的时候总是很难，因为人际关系基本上还没有发展起来，而且展示自己是一件很重要的事情”。

The performers‟ self-acceptance gets stronger as their efforts meet with an appreciative response: “Lovely shape, eh. Let's give them a lovely shape applause,” “Good work you guys.” A moment later this is matter-of-factly balanced by asking the teller,“(There was) something they didn't get?” In these few moments the appreciation visibly warms and buoys the performers and the lightly delivered feedback helps them keep their feet on the ground.

当演员的努力得到赞赏时，他们的自我认同感也随之增强：“造型真美，嗯。让我们为他们可爱的造型鼓掌”，“你们干得好”。片刻之后，讲述者问：“（他们）还有什么没有得到的？”这就理所当然地平衡了。在这几个瞬间，赞赏明显地温暖和鼓舞了演员，而轻快的反馈则帮助他们脚踏实地。

Later Bev coaches the group to let the applause in: “It (performing) is a service. Let it in when people clap. We are all learning. If you let us appreciate you, it's a two-way relationship.”

后来，贝芙指导大家让掌声入耳：“它（演出）是一种服务。当人们鼓掌时，让掌声融入其中。我们都在学习。如果你让我们欣赏你，这是一种双向关系”。

There is no harsh, berating coaching in sight. After a rowdy ‘over-the-top’ fluid sculpture, the first coaching is quiet and gentle: “One little thing, a little coaching. Look now at R. (the teller) sitting in his chair. Notice his eyelids. Do the same (fluid sculpture) but take that into account.” The re-play is much quieter, more focused. “Look at his eyelids – now, even more like his eyelids. And A. keep breathing, look out at us A.” Later Christian comments to me: “ Everything we are doing is leading to expression through stories. I leave out huge chunks of what I could work with – it would skew them. I'm trying to get them to have the courage to walk out there.”

没有严厉的呵斥式指导。在一场喧闹的“过火”流动塑像之后，第一次辅导是安静而温和的：“一件小事，一点指导。现在看看坐在椅子上的 R（讲述者）。注意他的眼皮。做同样的动作（流动塑像），但要考虑到这一点”。再次演绎时，声音更小，注意力更集中。“看他的眼皮--现在，更像他的眼皮了。A.保持呼吸，看着我们A。”后来克里斯蒂安对我说“我们所做的一切都是为了通过故事来表达。我舍弃了一大块我可以用的东西--这会让他们产生偏差。我试图让他们鼓起勇气走出去”。

The pressure performers inevitably feel from time to time to ‘get it right’, is addressed with an accepting wisdom. Christian: “We know the stage is a lonely place but we are on the stage with our friends. We love our companies! They love us, and mostly they love that we try. They have been to workshops, they know how hard it is.” In response to F. who is doubting her work having conducted E's story, Bev says with steady reassurance: Look at E. It was plenty good enough.” Christian adds: “If you do a tiny bit for the teller it is enough. And the group is touched.”

演员时不时难免会感受到“要做到最好”的压力，但他们都以一种包容的智慧来应对。克里斯蒂安：“我们知道舞台是一个孤独的地方，但我们在舞台上和朋友们在一起。我们爱我们的剧团！他们爱我们，更主要的是他们爱我们的努力。他们参加过工作坊，知道这有多难”。F 听了 E 的故事后对自己的工作产生了怀疑，对此，Bev 稳重地安慰道：“看看 E。这已经足够好了”。克里斯蒂安补充道“如果你能为讲述者做一点点事，那就足够了。大家都很感动”。

As a conductor Bev plays a key role in assisting tellers to express, accept and recognize their experiences.

作为一名领航员，Bev 在帮助讲述者表达、接受和认识自己的经历方面发挥着关键作用。

The effect of building this group culture is acknowledged during the farewell ceremony:

在欢送仪式上，建立这种团体文化的效果得到了认可：

“I've had a lot of great teachers and supporters in my journey, my softening, for this time. I want to acknowledge in particular Bev and Christian for your teaching. I have felt your complete and utter devotion to us. You have shown a deep consideration of where we are all at in our Playback and other journey's.”

“在我的人生旅途中，在我的软化过程中，有很多伟大的老师和支持者。我要特别感谢贝芙和克里斯蒂安的教导。我感受到了你们对我们完全彻底的奉献。你们深刻地考虑到了我们在 Playback 和其他旅程中所处的位置”。

“Kia ora whanau. (Greetings, my family.) Bev and Christian, thank you for building this nest to be in and encouraging us to jump out of it. Safety is a bugbear of mine. Thank you everybody for all the leaps you have taken, all the flapping, flopping and flying!”

“Kia ora whanau。（你们好，我的家人。）贝芙和克里斯蒂安，感谢你们为我们搭建了这个巢穴，鼓励我们跳出这个巢穴。安全是我的心病。感谢你们的飞跃，感谢你们的拍打、翻转和飞翔！”
