**Appendix 2**

**Describing A Playback Theatre Performance**

Playback theatre is an interactive form of theatre based on the personal stories of audience members. In the course of a performance, a series of stories are spontaneously told by volunteer tellers. Each story in then paired with a discrete dramatic enactment inspired by the particular text, mood and images inherent in the 'just-told' narrative. By means of evoking the performance scenario further, I will attempt to transport you to a performance.

You enter the space, in the Australian context this could be a contemporary theatre space, an old community hall, a school classroom cleared of desks, the boardroom cleared of tables, a courtyard between two accommodation blocks, indeed it could be almost anywhere such is the diverse application of the Playback Theatre method. However, regardless of the usual function of the place, it will have been neutralised as much as possible so that, together with the performing ensemble, you, the audience, can transform it in your imagination to a space well ready to hold a performance. There may be a stage, there may not. The transition of this place from functional to ritual space begins with the audiences' first reading70. Ideally, the entry is situated at one end so that the space communicates some orientation to what will

70 In the performances by Brisbane Playback Theatre Company, furniture is then arranged (often by the actors themselves who find this level of engagement with creating the environment intrinsic to their preparation to meet the audience well in a strange space. Unlike traditional theatre performances, there has not been the customary rehearsal period within which performers can claim the space. And, while the requirements of the space have been negotiated, this does not guarantee the physical, emotional and intuitive knowing that are an essential precursor for performers risk-taking and play. The reliance on spontaneity in improvisational theatre demands that performers' minimise likely causes of anxiety at all cost, and this physical engagement in evoking a spirit of performance in an unfamiliar space, is a helpful avenue for this. The efforts put toward energising and organising the space also contributes to transforming the space for the audience members. No space is neutral and some audience participants may know the space as a place for other functions, other behaviours.

become the focus of the performance - a large open area at the centre of a ritual circle. I imagine by now you have transported yourself to a familiar location (in your mind's eye) and made the necessary spatial changes I have suggested.

**The ritual shape**

The arrangement of the furniture is specific71: the audience chairs are in a semi circle, oriented toward the emerging performative space, what has been identified as the most neutral wall for example. At one side of the performance space (stage left), following the arc from one end of the semi circle of audience there are two chairs, facing forward. These chairs are significant in the ritual of Playback Theatre for it is from here that the audience-teller performs their story, seated alongside the conductor, who acts as a master of ceremony, host, and companion in the story-making process. At the opposite end of the semi circle, following the same angle of the arc as the two chairs, and therefore facing the two chairs, is a collection of musical instruments at the ready. These may consist of a guitar and various percussion instruments laid out on the floor around a cushion-seat for the designated musician. Alternatively it may be a piano, a cello, or a violin, it will depend on the musicianship of the performer. Regardless of the detail, it is from this place that the Playback Theatre musician/s will enhance mood and rhythm in the dramatic enactments of tellers' stories. Completing the arc is a row of stools (or boxes) from where seated actors listen to stories. The line of stools face outward toward the semicircle of audience chairs. These are ceremonial removed by the actors before, and replaced at the completion, of each discrete drama. Alongside the actors stools there is a 'prop tree' draped in fabrics that may be called upon to embellish characters, indicate location or other symbolic application - the

- A4-

transformative potential of a simple piece of coloured cloth is many. See Appendix 1 for a simple illustration of how the central open space is formed.

**The audience arrives**

The stage is set for a Playback Theatre performance and the roadies-come actors absent themselves as the audience begins to arrive. They trickle in, in twos and threes, sometimes there is a larger group, and often people will arrive alone. Diverse in their composition, they take up seats… The ritual has begun. Unlike traditional theatre auditoriums prior to the arrival of the performers, this interceding period can be filled with chattering voices as people begin to claim the space and make connections. At some point to mood is altered signaling the commencement of the formalised telling-enactment process of the performance ritual. However, this does not mean an end to the informal interactions. There will be other times during the process that this predominantly social behaviour is encouraged.

Let us visit the start of such a happening, various things conspire to signal the beginning. Let us look at the start of the Reconciliation show as an example of beginning.

*Children's voices shrill in the courtyard as they hurl the volleyball to and fro. People arrive in twos & threes,*

*chatting with one another as they pay the $10 surcharge. At the welcome table, Rebecca invites them to*

*complete a survey. "We really want to know who is here," she enthuses. At the back of the room, steam is*

*billowing from the urn, beckoning early comers. A man's silhouette fills the door. He comes alone. Looks*

*around as if to make sense of who is there, of the space, of his place. He sits near the back. More clusters*

71 On entering and seeing this new arrangement, it is hoped that the capacity of such audience participants to enter the performance is heightened. On entering and seeing this new arrangement, it is hoped that the capacity of such audience participants to suspend reality and engage in the performance is heightened.

*arrive, each with it's own familiar ease. Some people bring cups of tea back to their seats. The sole man*

*change his seat, he moves forward and sits with a woman, they appear to know each other. The room swells to*

*capacity. Nearing 8pm, there is an expectant air. We are all waiting to start.*

*The sounds of aboriginal clap-sticks signal the commencement. The room is now quiet and the calls of the*

*children outside seem amplified, pressing in on us, insisting that we include them in our ritual space. We all know we must. An actor enters and says, "*Why do I have to say sorry, I never did anything wrong*." She freezes in a defiant pose. There is much shifting and fidgeting in the audience. The discussion*

*has begun.*

**The show**

The performance then proceeds in a systematic way. The actors and musician, with the explicit purpose to engage and entertain the audience perform an opening sequence. This presentation is artistic and evocative; it signals the start. The opening sequence may also make reference to the context and purpose of the performance, ideally expressing an aesthetic, non-didactic style. The conductor then meets the audience and begins the process of inviting stories. In this early stage of a Playback Theatre performance, the conductor is looking to meet as many audience participants as possible, so that the links and connections between people begin to be made and the social distance between people begins to narrow. When the first audience member speaks, another transitional moment, marking the breach of traditional theatre's fourth wall, and the claiming of the space usually occupied by the privileged authority of writer and director. This is a delicious subversion of traditional theatre protocol and audience participants can move both toward and away from the idea of being a participant at this level. Simultaneously, it introduces that intoxicating performative dimension of 'doubt', but, rather than these being constrained to the domain of the

- A6-

performers as Meyerhold envisioned, it is also planted among the audience-as-performers. Thus it is crucial in these early stages that the conductor works with authority to both invite stories and to manage the interaction with the audience participant to ensure brevity, without subverting the spontaneous creativity she must enable the audience members to seize.

**Ritual and artistic forms**

To facilitate and accommodate the aesthetic and ritual requirements of the performance there are 'conventional' short forms to call upon. To this end, the first phase of the performance will see the conductor inviting specific contributions asking for a word, or phrase, that captures the tellers experience, rather than inviting the telling of the complete experience, which will come later in the process. The conductor works to maintain and build dramatic tension and other aesthetic qualities that will keep moving this interactive social event into the realm of theatre. Without this, there is a danger the performance it will become another talk-fest and diminish the potential for liminal experiences.

Given this, with all the best intentions for brevity and the inviting of specific moments in this early phase, there will always be tellers who want to tell more who need to tell more. It is the teller, in a dialogic process with the conductor, who drives the ritual each step of the way. The conductor must yield with such tellers, and also guide them in the co-production of the performance. This ensures that the needs of the individual tellers and the needs audience as a spectator group are met with some equality through an aesthetic imperative. In addition to managing the brevity of the telling at this stage, the conductor will generally limit herself to inviting the participant to speak out from their chair in the audience, resisting the move to the stage until there is sufficient momentum in the process and the ritual frame is firmer.

This enables the co-creation of liminal space to be made more explicit, without actually

- A7-

needing to state the meta-process at every step. This systematic building process facilitates engagement beyond the cognitive-self so that the playback theatre audience is also engaged at the feeling-, physical-, aesthetic-self. Thus, this early section is somewhat like having a number of conversations, for example, between the performers and the audience, and the audience with each other. One dimension of this conversation concerns the negotiation of the norms of the ritual process - the ritual frame - that will then hold the performance through multiple transitions and liminal activity.

**The enactment**

As each teller speaks out their story from their seat, a visual representation of this phase contains the conductor standing up in front of the audience, and the actors standing in front of their stools. The conductor speaks, and invites the audience to contribute. An audience member responds. The conductor says, "Let's watch!" The focus shifts to the stage area where one by one the actors enter building a sculpture that represents their reading72 of the teller's contribution. The sculpture is fluid, in that it moves rhythmically, there is sound that is usually abstract, and together the four, five or six actors build to a crescendo, at which point they freeze, holding the dramatic picture. Together, they then look to the teller in the audience to acknowledge their performing role in the piece, and their authority in the tale. The conductor immediately resumes the focus, and moves to another audience participant, who tells, and then a second fluid sculpture is created on stage. This shift of focus back and forward from audience to stage continues.

72 The players reading of the teller's narrative that is presented through the physical enactment is often referred to as 'the essence of the story.'

- A8-

There might be three or four fluid sculptures; there may be more. This decision is the domain of the conductor who is constantly vigilant to the emergent performance process, and in tune with the ritual rhythm the group is building in collaboration with the performers, with a similar feel for the movement of people toward each other. Minimising the social distance between participants is a key objective of the early phase of the performance. The conductor may give further attention to physically reducing social distance by having participants introduce themselves to the person next to them, or directing the audience participants to introduce themselves to someone they don't know73. This strategy also expands the liminal space, enabling those who have not yet had the chance to 'tell'

something, the opportunity to express a story that had been evoked and that they captured "just in case" the volunteered to tell, and then "just in case" they were chosen.

**Audience members move to the stage**

At some point in the performance, the conductor will initiate a move to the stage, and the transition from telling-in-the-audience to telling-on-stage. When this occurs, the audience participant takes up the role of performer more fully. The volunteer teller sits alongside the conductor, with the new perspective - looking out over the rest of the audience group, and tells their story. The conductor's role here extends to interview the teller more deliberately.

The function of the interviewing conductor is to shape the story and to simultaneously attend to the needs of the teller, the actors and the audience. As the teller recounts the tale, the conductor directs them to cast one of the actors as themselves, and maybe a second actor as another key character in the story. Actors may also be cast as groups, animals and inanimate objects, depending on the structure and content of the narrative. As the teller

73 Later, this inter-audience contact can be extended by, for example, after a number of fluid sculptures, directing audience participants to tell someone in an adjacent chair their 'story.'

- A9-

recounts the tale, the conductor is alert to the engagement of the audience, finding ways to maximise the potential for them to listen to the teller and engage in the story and remain engaged in the larger ritual process. For example, a story begins: "this happened when I was traveling in India…" and the conductor, recognising some recognition in the audience, might ask the teller to pause and turn to the audience and say, "who else here has been traveling in far off places?" Similarly, a teller may have said: "a cousin of mine is doing family history, the family tree"; and as conductor I ask: "who here has someone in their family who is doing the family tree?" Attending to this sociometry continues to build the links to the teller, even at this specific time when they have chosen to step out of the group and into the solo performance role as teller.

Once the story is told and cast, and the teller completes the telling, the conductor performs the transition from spoke narrative state, to heightened dramatic state, with the simple phrase, "Let's watch!" at which time the music surges and the actors lift their stools and carry them off stage in a dramatic exposition of the transformation they will from 'citizen' *listening* to 'actor' *responding theatrically and co-creating*.

**The enactment**

The musical interlude has a number of functions: it acts as a segue between the listening required during the telling, to the affective and symbolic domains evoked during the enactment; it is the first representation of the story, with the musician working to evoke the mood of the story in the performance; and it frees the actors up to re-enter the performing space with dramatic energy and intention. Meanwhile. after the actors remove the stools, they wait as the music swells into the open space. One-by-one they re-enter the stage to create the picture capturing the opening scene of the story. In the Brisbane layback Theatre

- A10-

Company, this is done in silence74. Once the picture is set the music fades and the scene comes to life.

The actors continue improvising scenes until the enactment is complete, at which point they freeze and look to the teller. This "looking" again signals their appreciation of the contribution the teller on behalf of the audience and the performance. It also shifts focus from the full stage, back to the teller and conductor at the side. The conductor then facilitates the transition of the teller from stage to audience. There is often some form of acknowledgment for the teller that signals a 'welcome back to the fold' by audience members nearby. During this transition the actors reset the stage and are seated ready for the next teller. The conductor then invites the next teller. And the process continues.

**Reinforcing the ritual frame**

The small domestic or mundane detail like the stating of "Let's watch!", the removing and replacing of stools, the casting of an actor in the role of the teller, builds both familiarity and tension throughout the show. Audience members are able to anticipate the action more and more, and therefore take up their authority in the making of the performance. Like all ritual theatre, it is the process that engages people, sometimes so much so that people come again and again 'to playback' regardless of the performance events' context and purpose. There are, of course, times when there will be variations to the order of events, and there are other short forms that can be incorporated into a Playback Theatre show. As ensembles become more experienced, there is scope for them to imprint their own aesthetic and style onto the simple structure.

74 Other Companies huddle and have some discussion about what will happen when.

- A11-

**Ending the show**

Regardless of the style of the dramatic acts or the combination of conventional forms that merge to make a Playback Theatre performance, the formal performance process eventually comes to an end. Here the conductor will effect closure in someway, from as simple as a spoken 'Thank you, that is the end of the show!' to a closing sequence that reprises aspects of the opening sequence but also echoes elements of the dramatic sequences that were created during the performance (Hosking, 2001).

**The buzz after the show**

After applause, the performers absent themselves. This signals another transition into the after-show buzz where participants often remain in their seats and continue to tell stories.

Others will mix and mingle. Some make direct moves toward a someone who has told a story; this can be to thank them; affirm their act; or to share the story they remembered on hearing the tellers' story. The performers from Brisbane Playback Theatre Company who were involved in the show then re-enter the ritual during this informal phase of the performance. It is during this phase that we hear about people's experiencing of the show. We might hear things that were unable to be said in the 'larger' public arena of the formalised ritual phase. We might hear encouragement and praise. The after-show buzz is the time we might hear things and experience things that confirms for us that this has engaged and affected people. Resonances for performers and audience persist for a period after the buzz.

Schechner calls this stage the aftermath. It is during the buzz or cool down phase and the aftermath phase that I spoke to the audience participants who contributed to this study.

1 FACILITATOR: OK, I just need to get you to sign this form. So, are you new to

2 Playback?

3 ELOISE: Yeah

4 SARAH: We’ve (Sarah & Bea) both been a few times before.

5 Silence

6 FACILITATOR: So you told the story about the shop?

7 SARAH: Yeah, yeah. We were just saying how um, well Bea and I were just saying

8 how it seemed less personal in a way because I think because of the topic of

9 reconciliation, everyone sort of was in the past, and we were just reflecting that

10 that’s just probably about – it shows you where we are at as a community, about the

11 issue of reconciliation, that (-). Like I was sitting there through the whole start and I

12 was thinking this far away from bursting into tears and I was thinking I can’t say

13 anything, because if I try and say anything I’ll burst into tears because the issue of

14 reconciliation is so emotionally fraught for me. And when I actually, when Rea

15 broadened it and I actually said my story, then I felt like I actually (-), I shared this

16 kind of emotion, and then I felt more able to participate then. And then when it got

17 back to the issue of aboriginal reconciliation, I felt better able to cope with it then

18 like, because it had (-). It’s quite a strange thing how powerful it is to see your

- A16-

19 stories because I contributed once before as well, and to see it acted out by, well

20 they're not strangers now because we know a few people in the group, but you

21 know by people who this is the first time they’ve heard your story, and they don’t

22 necessarily have all the background on you, and they can manage to pinpoint so

23 clearly, the emotions that you are going through, when you told quite a brief story. I

24 don’t know if that’s about the universality of experience though – like how would

25 you feel if you were in that situation, but I think Wow!

26 FACILITATOR: As an audience member?

27 SARAH: Yeah, and it’s the same thing when you are watching someone else’s

28 story, like that younger woman’s story about her grandfather, and the racist

29 attitudes. When she was telling the story it had this level of dimension, and then

30 when you see it being acted out, it’s kind of larger than life, it has this huge, well

31 not larger than life, but really vivid. You can really see what’s going on, at a much,

32 I think you can really see the different levels or layers of what’s going on

33 BEA: Typically of the emotions of other circumstances

34 SARAH: Yeah, it sort of broadens it

35 FACILITATOR: how did you feel, its your first time?

36 ELOISE: I found it quite confronting at first, just um, I wasn’t used to that kind of

37 theatre, yeah so I found it quite confronting that is was on a very emotional level.

38 Yeah, and I guess I was sort of watching that and I kept looking back to the people

39 who’s stories it was, just seeing if they were reacting in the right way, the

40 traditional way, and that was good, it was good.

- A17-

41 FACILITATOR: Yes I suppose there’s a possibility that quite a few people were

42 affected in that way. I was struck with the early moments, that they were mostly

43 quite unemotionally told, so then what happened on stage was really very different

44 from what was spoken, was that…?

45 ELOISE: Yeah I guess I was just trying to understand what was going on, to get the

46 format, and I guess I sort of got more involved, got more carried away with some of

47 the larger stories at the end. Yeah where they sort of developed a diverse look at the

48 issues.

49 SARAH: I’ve always found, I don’t know how many times I've seen playback, 3 or

50 4 times I think, but I’ve always find that in those initial things, cause I know Rea

51 and Jen and Anna, that I’m sitting there and sort of going so well, everyone’s really

52 uptight, and then always, it kind of reaches a critical point and whoosh everything,

53 like the audience kind of opens up and it all just seems (-)

54 FACILITATOR: When did you think that point was tonight?

55 SARAH: Oh tonight? Umm,

56 BEA: I think that first story about the clay

57 SARAH: Oh you thought it wasn’t until then? Actually, yeah I think that one was a

58 bit of a breakthrough, but I think that maybe when umm,

59 BEA: There were probably other moments before that

60 SARAH: Yeah. I think the initial one’s that are very short, the moments of your life

61 I think they’re always quite sort of, and that’s obviously a warm up thing in the

62 audience as much as for the performers and I think that tonight when Rea

- A18-

63 broadened it a bit, when she said OK, apart from the issue of aboriginal

64 reconciliation there are other ways that we need to reconcile, and I think people

65 BEA: Especially in your story, when people actually laughed a bit

66 SARAH: Yeah (laughter)

67 BEA: relieved, and I think that reconciliation is such a hard topic, that lack of

68 emotionality was probably about treading so carefully, not wanting to put a foot

69 wrong or say the wrong thing to, but to express a personal experience. And I think

70 with that broadening from Rea, and my sense of the laughter a couple of times, you

71 know just that sense of relief, we don’t all have to be so serious.

72 ELOISE & SARAH: Yeah

73 FACILITATOR: So was yours the first story after Ree said that?

74 SARAH: No, I don’t think it was

75 BEA: It was the second one, there were probably a few (.)

76 FACILITATOR: So, what were the stories that affected you most?

77 SARAH: I really enjoyed the woman talking about discovering her Cherokee

78 heritage. It was just so positive and invigorating. I thought that was really

79 ELOISE: Something that everyone could relate too

80 SARAH: Oh, do you think? Oh, yeah

81 ELOISE: Well just that thing that, as you get older you know discovering

82 something about yourself

83 SARAH: Yeah

84 ELOISE: You know maybe knowing that something’s been there your whole life

85 and sort of expanding on it.

**Appendix 5**

**Excerpt from unedited transcript**

**Sample 2 - After Show Discussion Group**

**Pride01**

192 FACILITATOR: When you told your story tonight Gigi … how was that?

193 GIGI: I wanted to tell more stories but I couldn’t think of any

194 MEL: Yeah

195 GIGI: I couldn’t know what words to put to them. Mmm

196 FACILITATOR: So is that the reason why you didn’t have any stories?

197 MEL: Oh no I tried to think of something but it, I think you’ve gotta wait for the

198 right time.

199 GIGI: Yeah

200 MEL: I knew I was going to say something tonight, and I came here and ‘I’m not

201 going to say anything’ and (-)

202 Laughter, yeah

203 MEL: And then as soon as I got here I just knew and I just waited until I just, the

204 right response, yeah. And I'm glad I did.

205 EMMA: and safe too.

206 FACILITATOR: What made it safe?

207 MEL: All women, made it safe for me and the space, the music was good what I

208 was talking about before, and it wasn’t a huge crowd, it was like yeah it wasn’t like

209 a big crowd, or audience it was just like a group of women sharing something. Like

- A20-

210 usually I hate small spaces, usually I can’t stand them. But tonight because it was

211 small it made me more comfortable. I think that when there’s too much space,

212 there’s too much space for the energy to go out and people feel like they have to

213 use. Which now I know that you don’t have to use it and you can stay together and

214 connect easier. And the songs before playback started to kind of set the relaxation,

215 and got everyone in the mood to sort of feel something cause those songs helped

216 me feel something so that sort of set the scene for the audience to get into it more, I

217 think that um, some audience have a bit of trouble getting into it and I think that the

218 songs set it really good.

219 EMMA: And the respect

220 MEL: Hmm

221 EMMA: Playback is [laugh] umm, gave everyone, the respect you gave everyone

222 MEL: It just sort of like (.)

223 EMMA: Yeah for me feeling safe in owning my own story, rather than just giving

224 something out there that’s going to be somewhat of a let down

225 Mmmm

226 GIGI: It’s core

227 EMMA: Yeah and I checked out seeing how it’s played back for other people’s

228 stories just how amazing you were, I don’t know words are hard to put to it, and the

229 music was perfect. I don’t know.

230 MICHAL: I liked it how like you are in tune with everyone else, like, you kind of

231 know you can always related to it, I loved that part, listening about the stories.

232 FACILITATOR: Yeah its stuff where you can easily say oh that happened to me?

- A21-

233 All: Yeah

234 MEL: And the actors were so like, when they spoke about something they were um,

235 the way they spoke was very flowing too.

236 EMMA: Karmic

237 MEL: Like you, sometimes people speak and it seems um, what’s the word?

238 HANNA: acting laughs

239 MEL: yeah, fake

240 Laughter

241 MEL: And abrupt, like you might say um, you turn around and say, you know, you

242 were all very respectful in the way you spoke. The way people told their story, and

243 I think that made a big difference for people, for other people feeling comfortable

244 to come out and say it and um, the speaking and the slow flowing sort of

245 movements helped me to calm down a bit and to focus.

246 HANNA: the pace isn’t it? Something about the pace, sort of taking the time to

247 really listen, um, and then taking the time to play it back in a way that’s not rushed

248 or driven or with urgency, that sort of thing.

249 MEL: it’s not hectic. It's sort of like it’s planned but its not

250 EMMA: its structured

251 MEL: spontaneous,

252 Yeah laughter

253 MEL: That’s a contradiction but eh? Laughter…

254 MICHAL: There was something interesting that I noticed like um, I suppose it

255 comes back to the performing and the energy, where sometimes I sort of did feel

- A22-

256 the energy like you said, sort of getting lost and then like, and I’d be feeling that

257 and wondering where’s it going, and then someone, would just go (sound)

258 EMMA: or do something yeah

259 MICHAL: and catch it and pull it back and then it would be just perfect again for

260 me, and um

261 EMMA: yeah

262 MICHAL: And there were a few times when I didn’t feel that strong connection

263 and I think that was good because I didn’t feel connected to some of the stories or I

264 didn’t feel connected to the way they were played, but then I felt, then almost like

265 really soon after, I’d feel really connected again. So it sort of like, it was like

266 catching it again for me. So um, I don’t know what I'm exactly trying to say, just

267 that it was really well done that, and when it ended, at the end it was just on such a

268 point that I think everybody in the room was there, everybody was capture, and that

269 was really good.

**Sample 3 - Individual Interview**

**Jul03**

17 MAXINE: I was totally unsure in the beginning. It was very personal, I wasn't sure

18 whether to participate or just observe. Then it started leaning toward a serious

19 tangent. I became interested, 'maybe there is some juicy issues here…' I thought the

20 use of music and sound and a couple of props here and there made the visualisation

21 heaps more effective.

22 REA: So you found yourself watching the actors, the devices they were using?

23 MAXINE: I wasn't really looking at the way you were doing things. I was more

24 watching the entire production. The teamwork was amazing, it had sensitivity

25 without (.)

26 REA: what most affected you?

27 MAXINE: I came away with a much stronger image and feeling of what goes on…

28 would have loved to see the mothering one (Previous show was themed 'Mothers').

29 REA: What was it like to tell your story?

30 MAXINE: It was very recent, the beginning of the week. I had a lot of time the

31 think travelling up north with my friend and I was quite reflective at the time.

32 Ordinarily I have a hectic schedule with little time to think about important things.

33 That trip slowed me down… I really like how it was done. I am over the top, I say

34 silly things, and I was drawing pictures on the way home in my journal, so I didn't

- A24-

35 forget about it (the trip up north). I thought, this is weird, a funeral of someone I

36 don't even know, this could be a little documentary. Anyway, I thought it was a

37 good thing to tell because I had not quite reflected on it, and other people had told

38 different things. That's what I liked about it actually, the structure, the theme was

39 not rigid, and there was a natural flow. But there is the advantage of having a

40 willing audience to tell the stories. It was interesting to me not knowing the theme

41 before I came, is it always like that?

42 REA: What were the timed during the show when you wanted to tell a story?

43 MAXINE: I could have shared constantly, but I thought I shouldn't. Just about the

44 travels through life, a million stories came into my head. At the beginning of the

45 year when Jonathan was away (he told an earlier story that was enacted as a fluid

46 sculpture), about our strong commitment, and how I felt totally free. There were

47 stories from my childhood… When I came I totally wanted to be clear minded and

48 relaxed, had a really enjoyable evening.

**Sample 4 - Individual Interview**

**MDA14**

8 SHARON: This is all pretty new to me. I went to the friendship meeting at MDA

9 with my friend Leeanne where I heard about the show. I recently began work with

10 the Stones Corner Community Ethnic Development Association and am responsible

11 for organising a production with the local refugee and tpv (temporary protection

12 visa) groups.

13 After the show I was speaking with someone else who was concerned that there

14 was no feedback or debrief session for people who tell stories. I thought this was a

15 valid point and felt this should be.

16 My main response early on to the show was that the actors did not have enough

17 skill to interpret the stories – it was all too narrative, all too literal, all to obvious.

18 I thought, “How can someone within 10 minutes of listening to someone’s tragic

19 story reinterpret it?"

20 So, the acting really annoyed me. It was repetitive, all very literal. The characters

21 were the same, the ideas were repeated, but the heart was there.

22 I found myself cringing a bit at the similarities: like the use of scarves, this was so

23 predictable; I knew they were going to grab the scarves. The story of the airport –

24 the flying bit – seemed similar to the journey in the Iraqi story; the travel, the

25 repetition of what was said. The gentleman actor always had the same role – hand

26 on shoulder.

- A26-

27 At the same time, I think it’s a great idea. It has good intention. Something positive.

28 I am glad I went. It made me stop and think how good my life is and how good

29 Australia is.

30 It was a personal experience about the war, rather than just what you get on TV.

31 I can see it helping me organise the multicultural production; by being there and

32 hearing Abibi’s story broadens my understanding of what it’s like to be a person

33 from a non-english speaking background.

34 I had a discussion with Leeanne. She was worried about the Iraqi family. I saw

35 them crying in the audience. This is just my point of view – I’m not sure what’s

36 right.

37 I felt that people felt pressured to tell

38 When I called out, my tactic wasn’t right. I ended up speaking over the woman

39 from the Ethnic Communities Council.

40 I feel the story was a bit sensationalised; I saw them crying; and then the quality of

41 the acting there so I was worried about them. It was a consumable version of what

42 was said. I was angry and frustrated about how it was done.

43 REA: would you want to get up there and act?

44 SHARON: No. I wouldn’t touch it – I wouldn’t have the skills,

45 I don’t know where to go with it though. Maybe different actors. People from

46 multicultural backgrounds.

47 Do you know about the multicultural play? I am really looking forward to it but I

48 am finding it hard to find actors. So, I am getting out and about. I talked to Guiliano

49 and Maree – we were critiquing it on the way out of the theatre; I also spoke to

- A27-

50 David from Mission employment that I thought it had a good intent; it had been

51 positive for me it broadened my understanding of relocation issues. But the actors

52 weren’t up to the task.

53 One thing that really got me going was the separation of families, it started me

54 thinking about my own family.

- A28-

**Appendix 5**

**Excerpt from unedited transcript**

**Sample 5 - Individual Interview**

**Rec04**

78 JUDE: Sorry I lost my train of thought, oh yes you were asking about the stories,

79 there are two stories I found sort of, quite moving, the ones that I still remember,

80 one is the woman who went to that workshop on aboriginal weaving or whatever it

81 was [pause]

82 RD: Fibrecraft

83 JUDE: fibrecraft, hm, I could feel the woman's pain, and it's, it also stuck in my

84 mind because it had a very clear connection to reconciliation, how do we practically

85 do it? How do we talk to people when we might not have a common language,

86 other than English, which isn’t always helpful, but where is our common

87 understanding of being human, it's just not there, and that pain, and that inability, or

88 not knowing how to bridge that gap, I think that was a very interesting story, um,

89 the other story that I thought was very interesting which had less to do with

90 reconciliation as such but more with identity, which is a problem for many people

91 with mixed blood and stuff, was the woman that came from the states, that felt half,

92 what was is?

93 RD: Cherokee, I think

94 JUDE: Cherokee, yes. I thought that was a story that was very well adaptable to the

95 situations of many people here in Australia who feel between cultures, and have a

- A29-

96 hard time adapting to either, or sort of positioning themselves, and feeling good

97 about whatever choice they make, about whatever position, so these are the two

98 stories I remember

99 RD: So personally, you could see that you had some of those, I mean you're from a

100 different culture, so where's my place inside and outside with that stuff

101 JUDE: Hm hm hm

102 RD: Yeah

103 JUDE: I don't think I'm there yet though, I haven’t asked myself that question, hm,

104 hm, have I? (.)

105 RD: You said earlier that you felt like you came home, or that this was home when

106 you arrived.

107 JUDE: Yes that's true,

108 RD: It's different, though, it's almost the opposite I suppose

109 JUDE: Yeah

110 RD: I mean this is the thing I guess, with people in the audience. I am not expecting

111 them to be doing high level process. I am expecting them to be fully feeling and

112 experiencing it. So, in an interview like this I guess I am asking you to look at

113 yourself and to do a bit of analysis with me. So I find, in a way, it contravenes the

114 subtle aspects of Playback Theatre in that it has it's own momentum, but on the

115 other side, at any time after a show people can talk to someone and also be doing

116 this.

117 JUDE: Hm hm,

118 RD: It doesn’t have to be as a result of an interview

- A30-

119 JUDE: Sure, hm

120 RD: So, while you were sitting there in the second part, you'd found you'd reached

121 a point of engagement where you told your story. And then kind of (-), you know

122 those were the first two, the one about the fibrecraft, and the one from the woman

123 from the US, they were the first two stories.

124 JUDE: I can’t remember the order of things.

125 R: I mean the first two after your (story). The woman with the fibrecraft and the

126 woman from the US, were the first two after you, then there was a fellow who

127 discovered that he had an African American grandmother.

128 JUDE: Oh, I totally forgot about the Spanish princess [laughs]

129 RD: Yeah, and then there was the young woman

130 JUDE: Oh yes, the young woman yes,

131 RD: Who told about her family conflicts. So what (was your experience) there, like

132 you'd forgotten, but you said you weren't as engaged then, was it because they

133 weren't so relevant to you?

134 JUDE: No, to be, can I be honest?

135 RD: Yeah I want you to be honest.

136 JUDE: I mean I did enjoy the whole evening. And I think that playback theatre is

137 great. What I was a little bit annoyed about was that it wasn't about reconciliation.

138 It was about people not really wanting to think through issues.

139 RD: OK

140 JUDE: Which is OK if that's what the evening is about. I mean I can do that and we

141 all need that and it's wonderful, but I thought, 'This has nothing to do with

- A31-

142 reconciliation', and I was then reflecting about it. Like why do you allow stories

143 like that? And I thought it must be pretty difficult, in an audience, you know where

144 people don’t know each other, where there is very little trust in the air, you know

145 how do you actually solicit engagement. And, um, encourage them to come up with

146 stories. And if you actually narrow it to reconciliation only, you might end up with

147 everyone sitting there and no one is actually saying anything, and you try to avoid

148 that like the devil. But then you know, still with bearing that all in mind I thought, I

149 would have preferred all the stories to be about reconciliation, in one way or

150 another. I don't know how you can do that though, but that's what I expected. That

151 the stories weren't about, 'Who am I?' But what about me and reconciliation?

- A32-

**Appendix 5**

**Excerpt from unedited transcript**

**Sample 6 - Observer Dialogue**

**OD0b**

223 REB: Yeah. I had a couple of things going on. The stuff about old soul, and here for

224 a short time resonates with my sister's story even though she was 14 when she died,

225 but that kind of sense of belief in what happens in the world, happens for a reason. I

226 really picked that up from Liam

227 R: Because your sister died too soon too?

228 REB: Yeah and his acceptance of it, fits with (-), and I found myself think, 'yeah,

229 you've come to accept this a whole lot sooner than I did.' That thought came

230 through my mind, and the baby bit, that's sort of where we're at with things at the

231 moment, I'm giving thought to that in my mind.

232 D: hmm

233 REB: You know, yeah, to see how fatherhood affected him was of interest to me.

234 And to see this man with such courage in sharing such a deeply emotional story. I

235 really felt, 'Oh wow, I really admire you for doing that; your courage.' But definite

236 (-) did you have any of that going on for you, that connection with personal stories?

237 D: Well in a way, I thought about us trying to have a baby and that it never

238 happened. And I wondered how it would have felt if we ever had that circumstance

239 where you had a baby and it only lasts for a short time.

240 REB: hmm

- A33-

241 D: Um, and in a way, it's sort of like a dream. It did touch me a bit because I

242 thought about our dream of having a baby, and it hasn't [happened], and we've had

243 to put it to rest. Really, and um, yeah it did affect me. It did cross my mind, and I

244 thought oh well, I don't really want to go there.

245 REB: I've got a job to do here

246 D: You know as I was making notes, I thought oh yeah

247 Rea: but it did get evoked eh?

248 D: Even though it was different circumstances or whatever, but I thought I wonder

249 what it would have been, and in a way, it was sort of symbolic. I have to bury this

250 idea as well, like he did.

251 R: Wow, so you could feel that symbolic relevance?

252 D: Well with him, and I thought well in a way it's similar to what we've had to do.

253 But for myself I thought I've had to put this to bed, bury it or something, so it was

254 similar

255 REB: Isn't it amazing that we can be sitting there watching someone else's story and

256 you're having all these things

257 D: Other thoughts

258 REB:/D: Going through your mind

259 Rea: So was it more evoked for you once you started watching the enactment?

260 REB: No, when hearing him, he was so well paced, in how he shared his story, and

261 quite sequential, and I could almost see it (-)

262 D: Yeah

- A34-

263 REB: As he described it. And the other thing that flipped through my mind was a

264 friend who lost her baby at 20 weeks, and I remember thinking 'oh, 20 weeks that's

265 the time when the baby is technical a child, rather than just a foetus, and you have a

266 choice about burial. Yeah all that was going through my mind, yeah so I gave a

267 thought to my girlfriend, because it was the same timing.

268 R/D: hmm

269 R: So Liam's was a deeply satisfying story for you?

270 REB & D: yeah

271 R: It had very true emotional content and people appeared comfortable expressing

272 sadness (.)

273 REB: yeah

274 R: Then we had the short enactments afterward. What do you recall about that?

275 REB: Yeah, um [the conductor] Jen asked what the story brought up for you

276 R: Yeah you have already alluded to the fact that you shared during that time

277 REB: I really needed to speak after that, I would have been just as happy if [the

278 conductor] had said turn to your neighbour, but I just needed to say something

279 about Liam, because I was so struck by that. The enactments, I can't really

280 remember them, I remember more what I said and what that guy said, I don't even

281 remember who else spoke.

282 D: Between you and that guy it was that younger woman,

283 REB: oh yeah, that's right, cause [the conductor] had gone back to her and said how

284 is that for you? Yeah

285 D: Then?

- A35-

286 R: Mike's remembering about the first time he became a Dad

287 D/ REB: that's right

288 R: so you're still strongly with Liam's story then?

289 REB: yeah, I think so.

290 R: yet you didn't necessarily hear other people's responses, you were still with your

291 own response?

292 REB: I think I got stuck after that guy had spoken.

293 R: you were incensed?

294 REB: yeah, very much so. Um, I'd be interested to talk about the stories that make

295 the whole audience laugh together as well as the ones that make us sad.

296 D: yeah

297 REB: didn't someone tell a story about the garbo truck?

298 D: that's right

299 REB: laughing

300 R: yeah I am happy to go anywhere with you guys

301 REB: well she told the story, and she was very descriptive in the telling of it, and

302 actually there was probably enough in there to want to see more than just a pair

303 D: yeah

304 R: oh, that's interesting you would have like to see more of the

305 REB: yeah, laughing, her response in terms of what she did do, and what she would

306 have liked to have done

307 D: that's right, yeah

308 R: So people laughed then eh?

- A36-

309 D: Yeah there was a lot of laughter, I've put here there were giggles and laughter,

310 everyone appreciated that, and the thing is I think a lot of people could relate to that

311 too.

**Appendix 5**

**Excerpt from unedited transcript**

**Sample 7 - Observer Dialogue**

**OD01**

1321 REA: Yeah, see so, I’m more curious about asking him about what struck him 1322 about the show, something simple and open like that…

1323 LU: Yeah, and I think he’d answer that quite well, like I don’t think he’d have any, 1324 I think he had a view on it, and he'd be able to talk to you about it.

1325 REA: So I’m thinking about him, then Darren, both Darren and Elizabeth made 1326 comments, like Elizabeth said the middle aged comment and Darren said, the first 1327 thing he said was ‘I didn’t trust the troupe’ or the actors or whatever

1328 DAWN: You?

1329 REA: No he

1330 LU: He didn’t trust them

1331 DAWN: OK

1332 REA: So because they’re the two people who actually said negative things I 1333 thought they'd be good to follow up

1334 DAWN: Hmm

1335 LU: Yeah, they had strong opinions

1336 REA: Yeah and what has happened since, maybe I’ll get nothing – these are just 1337 ideas at the moment, I’ll speak to the performers about it as well. Then I wondered 1338 about the woman, who put her arm up, she was very engaged

1339 CRAIG: Oh yeah

1340 LU: Yeah

1341 DAWN: Jude

- A38-

1342 REA: She was very engaged

1343 LU: She was

1344 REA: So she was also a lovely audience member for me, like a bit like you [Lu] I 1345 put her in that category

1346 CRAIG: Well she was experiencing that response all the time, she was (-) 1347 REA: It was externalised on her

1348 CRAIG: Yeah, yeah

1349 REA: That’s what I thought, whereas other people were a bit more (-) whereas it as 1350 very alive in her

1351 DAWN: Yes

1352 REA: But it was very animated with her

1353 LU: She’s the lady who told the computer story

1354 REA: Yeah. Now with these four women here, because they stayed in their small 1355 group at the end, I thought maybe about speaking to one of them about, you know 1356 asking one of them about that conversation, to get a bit of information… who 1357 would you have been curious to talk too? That might be a better question to put to 1358 you, you've said Kylie, who else in that audience are you curious to hear from?

1359 DAWN: Kylie, only because of her story

1360 REA: Yeah but you’ve been watching these people 1361 CRAIG: I’d only be curious about the guy,

1362 REA: Darren?

1363 CRAIG: Hm

1364 REA: You could see stuff going on for him?

1365 CRAIG: He seemed like a really interesting person 1366 LU: He was talking to the girl next him a bit 1367 CRAIG: Hmm, it seemed

- A39-

1368 LU: I’d like to have known what they were talking about 1369 REA: They were together I think, did they arrive together?

1370 CRAIG: No

1371 REA; Oh,

1372 LU: But I think they did know each other, the way they were chatting

1373 CRAIG: She was very quiet and

1374 REA: One of the guys I am curious about was the one who was lingering around 1375 the coffee at the end, or that man who came in and said ‘why do people come to 1376 this?’

1377 LU: That was the guy in front of us

1378 CRAIG: That was Darren

1379 LU: Oh, I thought it was the guy in front of us

1380 CRAIG: Yeah, yeah

1381 REA: The lone guy, oh was it Darren?

1382 LU: Wasn’t it the guy in front of us? With the little bag 1383 CRAIG: But isn’t that Darren?

1384 REA: So is he the one that said

1385 CRAIG: Yeah cause you were (-)

1386 DAWN: Oh I thought you were talking about (-)

1387 REA: You said 'lone male sitting by self finally found a friend' and said ‘I wonder 1388 why people come to these things?’

1389 CRAIG: I think that was Darren, yeah

1390 LU: Yeah

1391 CRAIG: Cause you said, “he just said (-)”

1392 LU: I overheard him talking to the girl next to him

1393 REA: Right.

- A40-

1394 LU: But it was more, ‘oh, I wonder why…”

1395 DAWN: Hmm

1396 REA: Good, anyone else? I guess I am going to have to be realistic so I am going 1397 to have to make some decisions which are going to be incredibly hard, cause not 1398 that everyone has spoken afterwards, I’ve got little insights…

1399 DAWN: So who? Ok, so who was Rebecca’s husband, the one who sat next to her 1400 because he was shifting a lot?

1401 CRAIG: He’d be good

1402 DAWN: He’d be good to ask I think

1403 CRAIG: Cause if he was so

1404 LU: Uncomfortable

1405 DAWN: It might not be so favourable

1406 REA: OK

1407 DAWN: I mean if he’s open to it, he must’ve had a different perception in his mind 1408 of what it was about

1409 REA: Yeah the trouble with an audience member like him is that I think he just 1410 comes for Rebecca

1411 DAWN: And he probably did…

1412 REA: I guess people do come to shows just because people want them to come 1413 with them

1414 LU: Yeah

1415 DAWN: Yeah, and initially I used to come for you

1416 REA: And you used to shift a lot

1417 DAWN: I used to shift a lot

1418 All: (laughing)

1419 DAWN: I’d be looking at my clocking thinking ‘god how much more of this’

- A41-

1420 LU: OK

1421 LU: (laughing)

1422 DAWN: I used to think what rubbish is this come on let’s go home

1423 LU: (laughing)

1424 CRAIG: Middle aged women doing psychotherapy

1425 DAWN: And men there too, I’d think ‘god what the hell are they doing up 1426 there…” (laughing)

1427 REA: Hey at Dick Smith, you can get a device you can put on your phone and do 1428 phone interviews can’t you? Cause I am just thinking that some of these people 1429 might not want to meet with me, but they might spend 20 minutes on the phone, 1430 because it’s a big ask isn’t it.

1431 CRAIG: Hmm

1432 REA: So I might follow up a few of them and see if they are open to it.

1433 DAWN: Hmm

1434 REA: The other person I wondered about was my sister’s husband because he said 1435 nothing in the show, nothing in the small group, and my sister has told me that as 1436 soon as they got in the car on the way home he said things like this make me want 1437 to become a politician.

1438 LU: Wow!

1439 REA: so clearly the theme, something must’ve gotten going in him

1440 DAWN: so ask him

1441 LU: He was listening in the group discussion

1442 REA: No one else? What about you? You’ve said Rebecca's husband, you said 1443 Darren. It’s interesting that we are wanting to know what the guys were thinking 1444 eh, there were so few of them, and only one spoke, and he spoke twice

1445 LU: I’m just thinking (.)

- A42-

1446 DAWN: You know who had things to say, and that was Sarah's friend Eloise 1447 REA: She’s ticked 'No' on her form, so I can’t call her

1448 DAWN: Oh, OK, cause she had lots of views actually even in her little discussions 1449 CRAIG: She sat there all night didn’t she, like she was watching… like just 1450 REA: She said some very interesting things in the small group

1451 CRAIG: Cause they’re together aren’t they?

1452 REA: No

1453 DAWN: Actually Bea and Sarah are

1454 REA: And Eloise is Sarah's best friend, They are like a little group, I think Eloise 1455 is straight

1456 LU: Eloise? Did she tell a story

1457 DAWN: No no

1458 LU: Oh

1459 REA: She had the little glasses

1460 CRAIG: No I was meaning Sarah's partner

1461 DAWN: Bea

1462 LU: The older woman

1463 CRAIG: Hmm, because she was very quiet

1464 DAWN: Yeah she was very quiet

1465 CRAIG: Very, just sitting back and just…

1466 REA: Yeah I thought of trying to look closely at her on the tape, I found her, there 1467 were a few people I found, who, you know, people who were clearly (-), they 1468 weren’t observing from out here, they were there but

1469 DAWN: Actually, yeah Bea didn’t say too much

1470 REA: She didn’t say much in the group (discussion) either,

- A43-

1471 DAWN: Yeah I noticed that and it’s not like her to be like that, Bea usually has her

1472 views.

**Appendix 5**

**Excerpt from unedited transcript**

**Sample 8 - Performance Text**

**Reconciliation Performance**

225 R: This is a time in the show when we press the pause button. It is time to enact

226 longer stories. We’ve done a number of briefer snapshots, or snippets, so “what's

227 the story” tonight? Maybe it’s a story you brought along, or maybe it’s a story that

228 was woken up as you’ve been sitting here. What’s he story you will tell tonight?

229 Take some time now to tell your story to someone by you. Tell then a few things

230 about it to practice telling. The next part of the show we will use the storytellers

231 chair and people will come and join me on stage to tell, which is very exciting.

232 [1:12:40

233 There’s a murmur across the group as people begin chatting. there is some

234 laughter, others are sitting still not talking yet.

235 A man goes out to the toilet

236 Actors get a drink

237 1:15:05]

238 R: OK! I will interrupt you there because there will now be time to tell each other

239 (.) Someone will come and join me. (…) Who is to be the first storyteller for

240 tonight? (A Woman signals from the front row) Come on up. (She makes her way

241 onto the stage and sits alongside me) Hi. What’s your name?

242 TELLER: My name’s Lorraine.

- A45-

243 R: (out to audience) Lorraine (the addressing the noise coming from the fans) We

244 now have the fans turned down a bit so people can maybe hear a little better. Um,

245 Peter, you’re at the back, maybe you can go like this if our voices are too soft

246 (gesture, hand to ear)

247 LORRAINE: Yes, I don’t have a very loud voice

248 R: That’s OK, we’ll manage

249 LORRAINE: Good

250 R: OK, Lorraine, please choose one of the actors to be you

251 LORRAINE: (leans toward actors) I’ve forgotten the names

252 R: you can point, (she does) Brigid? Great. (Brigid stands) So, what happens?

253 LORRAINE: Well, just recently I went down to Mittagong to do a workshop to

254 learn about aboriginal fibre-craft

255 R: (nodding) aboriginal fibre-craft, what is that?

256 LORRAINE: Making string-bags and baskets and that sort of thing (she gestures

257 with her hands here as if doing the craftwork)

258 [Man comes back from toilet]

259 R: (curious tone) right. Has anybody here done any of this work – fibrecraft?

260 [Pause] No. I can remember the dilly bags from my social studies textbook

261 [Some laughter and murmurs of recognition]

262 R: Do you remember dillybags? (Little responses from audience) So, (to Lorraine)

263 where were you?

- A46-

264 LORRAINE: Mittagong and the aboriginal women came down from Arhnem Land.

265 There were four Aboriginals there and they were teaching us, and there was a white

266 woman with them, she was a co-ordinator.

267 R: OK, (nodding)

268 LORRAINE: And when they instructed us, well they really didn’t, [laughs] they

269 would take the material (gestures here fast moving hands and fingers as if working

270 the ‘fibre’ and they would work very quickly with their hands and you’d stare at it

271 and try to figure out what the heck they were doing and then they’d hand it back to

272 you and you know, (as if they were saying) ‘just get on with it.’ [laughs again]

273 R: So this was a different way of teaching, clearly.

274 LORRAINE: Well they really weren’t teaching at all, they didn’t explain anything

275 and then you’d sort of have to work it out. Um, I was real uncomfortable with them

276 R: oh?

277 LORRAINE: If you asked them a question, they might or might not answer you. If

278 they didn’t feel like answering they just wouldn’t. It was as if you hadn’t spoken. A

279 couple of us would go off everyday and get lunch and we’d bring back these trays

280 of food, and the food wouldn’t be eaten and it would actually be taken back, they

281 wouldn’t eat it.

282 R: What did you make of this? This bringing of trays full of food and them not

283 eating

284 LORRAINE: Well it was my turn to do it, so I asked them ‘what would you like me

285 to get?’ and there was no answer.

286 R: So, what happened?

- A47-

287 LORRAINE: So, it was. And some of the women, there were about 15 of us in the

288 tour group, and some of the women were sort of bending over backwards to be

289 chummy and friendly and I didn’t know how to handle the situation. I wasn’t

290 comfortable.

291 R: When you say some of the women

292 LORRAINE: The other women in my group

293 R: Women who had traveled to Mittagong with you

294 LORRAINE: Yeah it was part of a big forum and there were lots of workshops and

295 this was just one of them.

296 R: What’s your hunch about why they didn’t eat the food?

297 LORRAINE: I just felt there’s a gap that I didn’t think I could bridge. I mean I

298 know aboriginal women here in Brisbane that I can communicate with as well as I

299 can communicate with anyone else. So I didn’t know how to

300 R: And that was difficult for you?

301 LORRAINE: Yes! I felt it was difficult and uncomfortable and I don’t think I was

302 the only one who was having that experience (laughs) I would like to be able to but

303 (shrugs)

304 R: But no matter what you tried in this situation there was a gap that you could not

305 bridge.

306 LORRAINE: (nods) Yes!

307 1:20:18

- A48-

308 R: OK (sitting further forward on seat out to audience) we’re going to see

309 LORRAINE’s story about travelling to Mittagong and coming up against a gap she

310 could not bridge. Let’s watch and listen.

**Appendix 5**

**Sample 9 - Excerpts from Reflective Journal**

**Extract Number I**

This is an early example of notes I made from the literature as I began to organise the focus of my study.

7/3/1

Need to find evidence on the absence of value of the Playback Theatre experience Many who contract PBT for the first time are naïve of PT's purpose/benefits, in fact they are often just looking for something new, or different, a treat, a diversion.

**Extract Number II**

This entry corresponds to some feedback about my conceptual framework and methodology. Early on I as struggling to effect any distance from my practice; and my self-referential reflective process. This was a reflexive period in which I was thinking about my thinking.

21/8/1

What is my interpretive frame?

How will I read my data?

I have been worrying constantly about entering the field. How do I ask permission. From whom do I ask permission? No matter what happens, my research is going to effect people. It is not neutral. This helps me to get some distance. I think one of my biggest issues is my closeness to the form, to the participants. I have some way

- A50-

to go before I feel as though I have consolidated my research identity within the playback theatre community.

Observation - I will be a participant observer.

Ingrid suggested I consider doing the data collection in my own community. She said to consider who might be interested in thinking this stuff through with me.

25/8/1

I am interested in the place of story in building connections, increase connection between people => increase in the sense of community.

27/8/1

North Coast Deanery performance - the strongest conclusion I have is that a dialogue happened and that in some way there were a number of elements of the community present. I was able, to some extent elicit stories from different sections of that community. This brought with it discomfort and conflict. I was then able to reinforce that PT honours subjective truth… each of us will have our own version of the story.

Playback Theatre could be said to be a dialogue. Stories are drawn from the audience and these stories inform each other and speak to each other. This study sets out to examine the dialogic nature of a PBT performance.

24/09/01

I am interested in the process that happens when we witness each other in moments of spontaneity - we are moved, we are shifted, we are changed. Part of me wants to be able to measure that, to take a picture of the energy of the performance - that exchange - but you can't.

- A51-

**Extract Number III**

This extract was written about a month after the Reconciliation performance and reveals some of my early thinking about the methodology. It also reveals my early reflections about the performance as a product.

24/05/02

This morning I am watching the footage of the audience as I listen to the performance, so I can’t see the stage. I have seen some of the stage footage, and so far have been finding it challenging to watch. There is a whole level of analysis that is engaged around my conducting and the enactments – I know it is rooted in the ways we always think about performances and it seems only natural that I would go through the same thinking for this one.

I think the performance went really well. Yet I am finding it hard to say that sentence to myself without some elaboration that tends to sound either negative or like I am making excuses. For example:

We had a last minute withdrawal of an actor, so ended up performing with just three [all women]– in the moment I wanted to rant and rave about this, and to have a discussion about the dynamic & resource difference of playing with just three. I must say I do think this conversation has probably been had many times before, but I have never seen anything written on it… [in the playback writings]

Then there was the gravity of the theme – reconciliation. At some level I worried that the performance would be overly intellectual, and so may have focused too much on this in the warm up… In hindsight I have lots of ideas about how I might have entered the stories of the night.

- A52-

Another thing in me has to do with the space. I deliberately choose not to use Macquarie House as I find it oppressive… instead I chose a hall where we’d performed a few times before. At the time I felt it offered what we needed, to set up cameras… and the rest. It had a stage area so we used that - it wasn’t a big stage, or a particularly big space, but … I have all these wonderings about how the space held or didn’t hold the performance.

Then as a consequence of all three of these things: three actors, the theme, the space, I feel like we never quite reached the aliveness required to build a good dramatic journey…

Anyway having said this I am extremely pleased with the outcome of the show.

People were there to genuinely explore the notion of reconciliation. We had amazing stories that disclosed aspects of reconciliation with self, with family, with ancestors, and how to live with the various values one absorbs over time. There were no indigenous Australians…

We had a story from a woman who had just come from a fibre-craft workshop with women from Arhnem Land, then a woman who has Cherokee heritage who wants to claim it, but knows this would not be sanctioned in the US. The third story was a man who had a family history of association with aborigines with the un/spoken qualification ‘but you don’t marry them’, this having something to do with keeping the children ‘pure.’ He dated an aboriginal girl as a young man… but the climax was that after his dad died, and family tree exploration revealed that the great grandmother who was proudly known as Spanish, was in fact African… A young woman came to tell the final story, in her story she actually confronted her grandfather about the un/spoken racism that she lived with when she was a child with aboriginal neighbours (living on the wrong side of the tracks).

- A53-

What’s fascinating is to track the conversations that occurred next. There were stories just coming awake in people who initially felt the show was ‘soft’ or ‘propagating the us/them thing’ – ‘where were the aboriginal Australians?'

There was a conversation that critiqued the concept… what is reconciliation? What does this word mean and where does it come from – while on one level I found this conversation particularly intellectual with a bit of covert ‘teaching’ going on, or at least some attempts to influence rather than just listen, new stories were eventually told, with the debate being expanded to include the German/Jew, and Christian/Jew conflict.

In another group people told a whole series of stories about Redfern in Sydney, a place which evoked … mystery, intrigue, danger, curiosity – a place that epitomised somewhere/some people who were different from ‘me.’ In this group there was a guy who had seen a bit of playback and I think is very drawn to it, but has not yet been in a company. He began saying he didn’t feel safe with the actors, and over about 45 minutes he added to his story – ‘it wasn’t the actors, it was that I thought everybody knew each other’ then ‘it wasn’t that really, it was more that more story was confused inside me…’ to eventually telling some of it to those in the small group… very interesting – his mild hostility was transformed once he admitted how disappointed he was that he didn’t “get to tell it.”

Another woman spoke to Rebecca at the end – Rebecca has invited her, so this was a friend to friend kind of comment I think… she was saying how she just didn’t get it, why would anyone want to tell a story? She identified herself as a writer and spoke about how she can’t even be in the same room with someone who is reading her work, she questioned who owns the story… anyway I am not so sure whether the comments were from her head or whether there was other stuff engaged, so I am hoping to interview her. Rebecca spent time explaining playback to her though, which would probably happen in the course of such an event, but this may influence how she responds about playback in an interview.

- A54-

Having said all this, I felt that the conversation that formed the bulk of the performance really demonstrated a genuine attempt to discuss where individuals were currently placed in relation to the notion of reconciliation. Perhaps more interestingly, there was considerable reflection on those areas in people’s lives where they have direct opportunities to act with respect to being reconciled/connected. Also, there is now the problem of finding focus with respect to what the research is asking and at this stage I feel far too close to the show to be able to fine tune that.

That’s enough for now. Feeling tired, meeting with observers tomorrow and fellow performers on Sunday to discuss the show.

**Extract Number IV**

This extract from my field journal demonstrates the thinking I was engaged in following the Mental Health Week Performance.

28/10/02

[MHW perf]

I have been reflecting on the role of the conductor - I was thinking about Nathaniel and how I omitted to ask him for a reply to Hillary's story - indeed I didn’t know he was there, but I should have known. This raises questions about safety… but not the safety of the teller, the safety of those told about. Extending this I recalled my work at the Refugee perf, and how I acknowledged Woorid's story as her family's story by acknowledging them, and afterwards, asking her Dad for his response. He said, "we suffered." Anyway, there were some comments from the feedback - people being worried about the family, and I felt that in some way, my asking him for a response was criticized a bit, so what's the right answer? Of course, I have to seek out others in the audience who are in the story.

- A55-

[chasing a theme - to tell or not to tell]

Sometimes, it is the fact that others are in the audience that stops people from telling. That was [name's] greatest fear, that there would be large silences, that no one would tell because they didn't want the others hearing their story. Another woman also referred to this as a reason she did not tell. Her story was about the chooks she shared with her neighbour. She had not had a chance the talk with her neighbour about it yet so didn't want to bring it up in public - yet it was the thing that came to mind when invited to share a story that showed her in conflict with herself.

Later on Friday, I began to think about the other person in the research who I felt most disturbed with - Asha. Again, she was a nonteller, in someone else's story. I felt a sudden surge of … [ this is not a word place].

Again, that was a show where the conductor had not identified the other person. Wil came and told *his* story. But Asha was there, she was in the story. She had her own version of the story… It was also a life and death story, a big story. In Nathaniel's case, he could interpret the story as him having some hand in Mac's death. This is not so for Asha. But the part of the story she focused on as Wil needing to resolve, was the interaction with her over the burial of the baby… I wonder what Nathaniel's version of that story would have been… does it matter.

In Asha's story - I played Asha, after I realised I was playing someone in the audience I felt ashamed, worried about her, let down and unsupported by the conducting.

**Extract Number V**

This extract is a poem I wrote when I was finding it difficult to express myself in writing.

… during a show, different audience members are negotiating with themselves as to whether to tell or not. This constant weighing up, introduces an air of uncertainty, or doubt (as Meyerhold says), and therefore has implicit in it an aesthetic quality.

There could be participation from the audience at any moment. But more significantly that they, the audience has some kind of control over it.

**Data Analysis Schedule**

| Date | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| July 2001 | Stage 1: Trial data collection - practitioner's analysis of performance |
| Nov - Jan 2002 | Stage 2: Extended practitioner interviews |
| March 2002 | Stage 3: Intensive Data Collection -

I commenced data collection with the specific aim of developing observational frames. Placed (participant) co-observer in the audience to compliment my on-stage observational point of view and to test feasibility of observational goals. Began sourcing audience informants and conducting initial conversational interviews (Wolcott, 1995).
Recording of field notes and journal reflections

Decision to videotape performance to assist in observation. Permission to use video-documentation.
Preliminary analysis reveals the value of audience interviews and I start to see the limitations of player interviews. |
| May 2002 | Observational frames broken up to cover the event from inception, preparation, performance, through to the cool down or aftermath (Schechner, 1985).
Specific performance produced for purposes of research and to trial video documentation as a way to maximise the observational data gathered. This decision was based on the indications from previous performances that multiple data sources intersect and provide some form of triangulation.
Collection methods during the videotaped performance included: participant observation; feedback survey to source |

| June - July 2002 | Decision to abandon video-documentation.
Ongoing fieldwork, over the next eight weeks collected data from every performance.
Sourced participants for conversational interviews using the simple survey form. Inconsistent opportunities for after-show group discussions due to the context of the performances.
Data analysis; identified basic thematic categories; progressive funneling to guide next phase of data collection |

**Example of Thematic Analysis of Stories** **Reconciliation Performance**

Early in the performance, audience members brought forward a number of ideas,

suggesting that the concept evoked a wide range of responses. This negotiation of the terms, concept and practice of reconciliation eventually took a course in the show as the application of the method moved from shorter forms to the longer forms in the storytelling process, where a participant comes on stage and tells their story with the support of the conductor.

***Themes in early part of show***

- Regret at not knowing the truth of the aboriginal experience

• Wanting adequate compensation for the work that indigenous Australians performed when they were bonded to the state

- The confusion of living with mixed messages about aborigines during childhood
- The inspiration of prominent aboriginal leaders

• Feeling angry about the lack of apology to indigenous Australians for inhumane treatment in the past

- Noticing a shift in attitude toward aboriginal students being "problems" in the school system
- Coming to terms with new knowledge about the idea of reconciliation going back to the teachings of the Catholic Church and excitement that this is linked to the idea of being connected into humanity and forgiveness
- Daring to present oneself honestly and the hurt resulting from a prejudiced response to personal honesty
- A61-

- The dilemma of managing a deep commitment to activism with the need to prioritise time

• The struggle of feeling implicated in someone's personal business when it contravenes your values

The themes that are articulated above represent my interpretation of what I have heard and seen during the performance. From my observations, many of these themes were echoed throughout the performance, emerging in other stories that were told. One emphasis that I identified in the stories told during the performance revolved around the question: "how to do reconciliation practically" (Rec04, L84). There was a range of responses to this question in the form of other stories. These responses included: implicating the self and the family as domains in which we can practice reconciliation, learning about yourself and your values, learning about your family and your family values, and daring to challenge beliefs and values held by family members.

The date reveal that an exploration of these themes continued in the after-show discussion groups and into interviews two and three weeks later./ Stories told later also contributed slightly different perspectives on what was told during the performance, or brought forward themes that had not been emphasised in the performance. During the performance there was a reference to the idea of the way the Catholic Church ethos espouses reconciliation. Transcripts reveal that this context was explored further in one discussion group (see Rec03). Perhaps the way in which I conducted the performance influence the way in which this idea

- A62-

was somewhat disregarded in later stories. Audience members might have felt more inclined to tell if this theme had been given more attention (Rec13, L18, Rec14, L52). Simple conducting action75 within the performance process could have assisted these audience members to add their voices to the performance. This would possible have resulted in some acknowledgement that there were others in the room that knew about Catholic reconciliation making a concrete link between the teller and these other audience members within the ritual.

Undertaking this kind of analysis of the content that emerges during the performance can also assist the conductor to identify what stories may have been missing and what voices may have been absent. It is possible that there were also a number of themes that were not voiced at the performance. Transcripts of after-show discussions reveal stories of overt racism, stories in which people felt angry about, unconcerned by, disgusted by, and disinterested in indigenous Australians (see for example, Rec02, Rec15). Other absent stories what were revealed after the show include the witnessing of specific atrocities against aboriginal people (Rec 14) and stories that the audience members adjudged were too damning of white Australians to feel safe voicing them (Rec13). Again, specific conducting statements and invitations could have illuminated these themes in the show, even though this may not have resulted in the full telling of these stories. The conditions to tell a story during Playback Theatre depends on many variables, some of which are intrinsic to the values, beliefs, experiences and skills of individual audience members.

75 This would involve a simple inquiry such as, "who know of this in the Catholic Church?" -A63-

I am not suggesting that all themes should be brought forward within one

Playback Theatre event. However, the conductor's role must give attention to these small offers from the audience. This is the *content* of the performance, and the values of Playback Theatre imply that it is toward the audience members'

agenda that the performance must veer, not that of the Company or the organiser.

I made the following note about the Reconciliation performance in my reflective journal:

I know I wanted my conducting to be unobtrusive but I can't believe how little I do with the tellers. I am sure my desire to be enabling rather than overly zealous because of the research made me more timid (than usual). At times, I think this (my style) worked really well, but I think that sometimes it was too hard for the actors.

And I miss checking in with the audience too. Like that reconciliation in the church one was out of the blue, I should have found a link for her. I related to her discovery so I think I assumed others would too. This possibly blocked me bringing this out more (Reflective Journal, June 2002)..

**Unedited Transcript: Carly's story**

**Disability Action Week Performance**

Carly is onstage, her wheelchair pulled up alongside me, the teller's chair off in the background. She is a playful teller who has poise and is also comfortable with the attention.

CARLY: it was a disability awareness thing combined with indigenous awareness, and sport & rec were involved, and one of the things we organised was this game of basketball and there were people who were used to playing wheelchair basketball, and people who were used to playing basketball standing, and we got them organised in wheelchairs.

R: Really? [to audience] Who here has tried using a wheelchair who is used to standing? [there are no takers] [to Carly] So, what was it like for them?

CARLY: [giggling] well it's that whole thing of sitting in a chair, but then having to make the ball go in the same hole (that they were used to reaching from standing height), and then, maneuvering, and they were falling round all over the place

R: so a couple of words for them,

CARLY: a mess

[Audience laughter]

CARLY: at first, and there was real reservations, the way the 'wheelies' were playing

R: so what was the reservation about?

- A65-

CARLY: I think it was that you had people who were proficient in a skill and they were put into an environment where they were not competent.

R: so were they all athletes, yet were ***not competent*** (emphasise last two words) CARLY: Yeah, (there was) a mixture of guys and girls, and it is interesting I think the crowd was on the side on the non-wheelchair basketballers, and had a fairly big laugh at their expense

R: [to the audience] OK, (you will behave) as the crowd. You guys are really enjoying this. Let's have a practice of this

Audience: laughter and comments

[CARLY enjoys their participation]

[More laughter]

R: thanks

CARLY: and to exemplify that (here Carly explains the physical constraints of catching, passing and bouncing the ball when in a wheelchair). When you're sitting down, you know when the ball comes, you can't jump you have to let it land, and the same for dribbling, if you stand with the ball, anyway these are the things that these players are trying to do

[Audience Laughter]

R: so they're trying to jump

[Audience Laughter]

CARLY: yeah

R: so how did it go?

- A66-

CARLY: fabulously because after a period of time when they were all over the place, because they're skilled in many ways, and that was helped (when they were ) in the chairs because we gave them some advice about how to use the chairs, and so there was interaction there, and so they got more comfortable, and their natural basketball skills started to override their inexperience with the wheelchair, and it became much more even, and there was a wonderful connections with the players and also the audience, yeah it was great [pause]

R: Great (nodding at Carly). (To actors/audience) At the beginning of this story they're will be some "parallel-world" time so that the actors can establish the world of the proficient wheelchair basketballers, and then the world of the less proficient wheelchair basketballers before the two come together. Let's watch

**Example of Ongoing Storytelling**

**Post-performance period - Reconciliation (Rec03)**

The following excerpt is from a discussion group following the reconciliation performance and shows the emergence of stories in the cool down:

Man 176: you just bringing that up then just reminded me, and I haven't thought about it a lot. My first wife ran the aboriginal preschool in Everley Street in Redfern, and we used to have two cars one that we'd drive and park in Everley Street which was covered in aboriginal flags, and the other car which we didn't take there, and there's more that goes on around that, but actually from you (Paul) just talking there, somehow I remembered all those things. I didn't remember it for one second out there, and now I've got all these stories that have suddenly emerged in me right now.

Woman 1: actually what you just said about Redfern made me remember a whole, one of my friends used to live around the corner from there and we'd go walking past it, being part of their life, part of their lifestyle, like having the guts actually to walk down that street

Man 1: you get used to it

76 Use of Man 1, Woman 1 & Woman 2 here to discriminate between different voices.

- A68-

Woman 1: you know, far out what the hell did they burn their house down for? Did they need fire wood. You know like just to be in the middle of it and not understanding and somehow being detached.

Woman 2: Yeah my grandmother lived at Sydenham which is two railways from

Redfern, and we'd go down for school holidays, and my nan would say do you want to go on the train? We'd get on the train, and go forever (just having a train ride) anyway Redfern would be one of the stops – and the whole of that area was just so wild and different to us because, and there were all these Italians, and there were just waves and waves of migrants so it was just like difference on a plate, and it was like indigenous Aussies were just more of the difference, and somehow when I got older. It wasn't my grandmother's doing and I don't know how we found out but Redfern was this really out of bounds, and you don't get out there (the station) and walk around or whatever. Anyway its sort of like these things come into you, you know you don't necessarily get it as a kid but for me, there was all the same, it was all incredibly different from a small crops farm south west of Sydney on a dirt road. Going into Sydney and seeing you know, Greek family or Italian family, and they're all selling things in shops and it smells funny, you know…

Woman 1: experienced so much here, to have all that here in this room, something about playback (very soft). (Rec03, L204).
