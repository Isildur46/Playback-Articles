# CHAPTER SIX: Crossing the Threshold: Initial Engagement and Participation

There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening, that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and will be lost.

Martha Graham (1951)48

In the spirit of Martha Graham, Chapters Six and Seven represent my particular reading of the data. Through consultations with informants I have learned that each of them has their own unique experience of the Playback Theatre performance. Audience members' experiences of the Playback Theatre performance arise from two identifiable and interactive positions, the familiar spectator position, and that of the less familiar role in the context of a theatrical event, participant. Audience members readily accept their place as theatre spectators at Playback Theatre finding it familiar and recognisable. The role of participant, however, is not automatic or straightforward for all people. Despite Playback Theatre being promoted as an interactive experience, some audience members are often surprised by the degree to which their involvement can influence the content and spirit of the show. Nevertheless, audience members generally embrace the possibility of participating.

48 In Nachmanovitch (1990, p.25).

The two chapters are organised following the chronological progression of a Playback Theatre performance: pre-performance, performance, and post-performance. Chapter 6 presents the collection of findings and discussion on audience members' experiences of participating in the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance. I cover the initial engagement in the event and the experience of reflective distance for audience members as they separate from the mundane to the heightened world of the performance. The findings associated with spectating are presented in the next chapter. Chapter 7 also reports on audience members' experiences of the after-show period where they go through various levels of integration as they move from the ritual performance space to that of the ordinary everyday world.

As reported in the Methodology chapter, the findings have been consolidated through an iterative process of interviewing and observing, transcribing and analysing, and interpreting and writing. The themes that I identified early in the process had been influenced by the frequency of certain experiences in the data. These have been extended through written reflection and reflective dialogues and the search for audience experiences that contravene the early dominant themes. Additional reflection has focused on interrogating the way in which my biases and assumptions have perhaps influenced the organisation of the data. A number of singularities have been noted and included. The findings are composed as an inter-textual account weaving selections from the data with my interpretation, and samples from the literature.

**6.1** **Initial Engagement**

The way in which audience members approach their preliminary engagement at the Playback Theatre performance is influenced by a number of factors. In this section I discuss those factors that impact on audience members' initial engagement and introduce the reader to the notion of reflective distance. I establish how this informs and directs the way in which audience members participate and spectate throughout the performance. Interspersed throughout the findings that are reported in the chapter is reference to the way in which the various factors affecting initial engagement and reflective distance might continue to impact on audience members at the Playback Theatre performance.

**6.1.1** **Factors Affecting Initial Engagement**

Interviews and observations49 suggest that audience members arrive at Playback Theatre with certain expectations. These expectations arise in relation to the reasons they have for coming to the event. Initial engagement appears to be shaped by audience members' prior knowledge of Playback Theatre and their affiliation with the context informing the event. On arrival, the venue, audience size, and audience composition each or all impact in various ways to influence the initial engagement of individuals at the performance.

*Reason for coming*

Audience members have attributed their primary reasons for attending to their affiliation with the context, their interest in the Playback Theatre form, or their association with another. Audience members familiar with Playback Theatre have suggested that their attendance at a particular show has been equally influenced by their affiliation with the context and their interest in the form.

*Affiliation with the Context*

Audience members come to Playback Theatre because of an affiliation to the broader context or with the broader community within which the performance is placed50. For example, the

49 Dawn identified that audience members' expectations seemed to play a significant role in how people initially engaged.

50 In the previous chapter, I have documented the performances in the study, showing that five of them were situated in specific contexts or what could be called communities of interest. The promotional material for these performances alluded to the generic purpose of the community event as a forum for personal stories that was contained, creative, and celebratory. It introduced the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company and gave a brief explanation of the Playback Theatre method. (See Appendix 3 for examples of promotional material for DAW performance). The other three performances were part of the Brisbane Playback Theatre

Company's Public Performance Program 2002. Themes for these events were not publicised. Promotional material claimed that the performance would "bring together people from all walks of life for an evening that honours stories from the community" (BPTC, 2002).

performance staged during Mental Health Week in a provincial centre north of Brisbane was promoted in the context of an extended program of Mental Health Week activities. This ensured a wide reach through the relevant networks. The performance was commissioned for the launch of a rehabilitation package, The Recovery Kit, developed especially for mental health clients by others who have made a successful transition to living in the community and managing their mental health. Audience members' relationship to the broader Mental Health context, as discrete from the Playback Theatre form, was intrinsic to their attendance. After the show one woman has admitted that she 'didn't know [Playback Theatre] was going to be there so I didn't know what to expect' (Alice, MHW01, L22). There were similar comments made in relation to performances conducted during other *Weeks* due to a practice of attending community functions to support awareness raising. For example, a woman has stated that the occurrence of the performance during Disability Action Week provided sufficient motivation for her to attend. She added, 'I didn't have a clue what it was about' (Carly, DAW06, L100). At times, the surprise audience members experience when they discover Playback Theatre impedes their engagement. This is explored later in the chapter.

*Familiarity with Playback Theatre*

There have been audience members at each performance that have attended because they felt a particular affinity with the Playback Theatre method or community. This is expressed as a particular interest in the aesthetic of Playback Theatre and a desire to witness the form in action. These audience members often have previous experience of Playback Theatre and express the belief that it could be a good way to explore the stated theme or engage with others in the specific context (see for example: DAW07, MHW04, Rec05, L283, Rec07, L180). Others may have been unfamiliar with Playback Theatre but came because it was publicised as "theatre", "stories" and/or "interactive" in the promotional material, or by others.

Alternatively, audience members may have been urged to see the form because of how it aligned to their other interests (see for example, Rec10, Rec12, Jul01, Jul04).

*Combined reason - context and form*

Audience members who have come with an interest in the form and some affiliation with the context can experience a strong initial engagement due to 'consciously' bringing 'all the stuff [they] have about the topic' (Helen, Rec08, L328). In the example below, Jude expresses that she was motivated to come because of reconciliation and because of Playback Theatre. Unlike others her interest in Playback Theatre equates to an evaluative purpose, and in many ways provided a third reason for coming. She says:

I had two reasons really for coming. One was to look at the form with a view of,

'Is this a suitable thing for what we are planning for refugee week', and the other thing was that I was involved in a reconciliation learning circle and we did great things together, and it petered out. I thought it's about time I relooked at what does reconciliation mean to me, so that's the second reason I went (Jude, Rec04,

L14)

While her desire to reconnect with some element of activism in her past has motivated her to come to the performance she concludes that the way in which Playback Theatre has facilitated the exploration of the reconciliation has been limited.

*Affiliation with an individual*

Some audience members have attended a performance because of their relationship with another. In some cases this has been a husband coming with his wife (see for example, Rec10, L79, Jul02, L4), people coming with friends or work colleagues (Pride02, Rec14, MDA12, 14, Jul01, 04) and mothers coming with daughters (Rec13). There were also people present because of their relationship with a performer in The Company (see for example, Rec06, Pride03).

In conclusion, a number of tensions emerge directly from why people come to the Playback Theatre performance, particularly when their reasons extended beyond their personal commitment to the theme or the form. What has emerged is that it is likely that an individual's reasons for coming lead to certain expectations. The way in which these expectations are met, not met, and in some cases exceeded, often determines how the individual engages in the process and their subsequent experiences of the performance. These experiences are discussed as they appear throughout this chapter.

**6.1.2** **Reading the Audience and Venue**

Bennett (1990) reports that on arrival audience members engage in a reading of the venue and the audience as they integrate into the social environment. The reasons people come to a performance contributes to a multifaceted audience composition. Some audience members have reported their analysis of the audience composition in interviews. For example, one suggests that:

[T]here were two distinct groups - people that know Playback Theatre and people who come because of the theme or because they belong to the organisation. …

The more mixed [the audience is] the harder it is to (find a) focus that resonates with the whole audience (Otto, MDA05, L5).

Observation data alludes to Playback Theatre audiences as 'a group of many groups' (Rea, OD03, L96) and as 'individuals, groups and couples' (Craig, OD01, L224). Bea reports that the audience at the Reconciliation performance was 'disparate' and remarks that 'it held together better than I thought it was going to' (Pride02, L404). Sarah assesses the same crowd suggesting that the 'holding together' that Bea alludes to was an unexpected and mysterious part of the ritual experience. She says:

[What] I find amazing is how quickly the trust builds in the group. It's not like a workshop you've just paid for and you've said, 'Ok these are the rules of engagement here: nobody is to interrupt anyone else, etc.' It's not like you've stated them, but its kind of an unspoken thing. It's interesting at the Reconciliation one actually, because that was such a mixed group and it still happened. There were men there, a lot more men than there is usually, there were straight people there as well as gay, and all different classes of people. It quickly became this intimate space where it was safe to tell your stories (Sarah, referring back to Reconciliation performance during interview about Pride performance, Pride02, L62).

These readings of the audiences at the Refugee and Reconciliation performances indicate that who is there has some bearing on audience members' initial engagement. Informants suggest that at times it is actual composition, i.e. accurate or known information about others in the audience that has influenced their initial engagement. Assumed information about the audience also impacts on initial engagement. Conversely, who is missing or whom people came to the performance with could influence initial engagement.

Reading of the venue is also implicated as influencing initial engagement. Previously, I state that the venues for these eight events have been chosen on the basis of size, accessibility and appropriateness to the interactive needs of Playback Theatre. Availability and affordability were also factors. Data suggest that the venue has not been a neutral element for audience members' initial engagement.

The tensions arising from what is unexpected and the adjustment audience members make in response to this is not limited to their initial engagement at the event. Later in the chapter I discuss how these factors contribute to helping or hindering an individual audience member's capacity and desire to participate, to experience flow, and to enter the collective experience of communitas in the ritual process. Next, I introduce the concept of reflective distance and report various examples to illustrate audience members' engagement in reflective distance during the Playback Theatre performance.

**6.1.3** **Reflective Distance**

Regardless of their expectations of the event, what they encounter on arriving at the venue and at the commencement of the performance, audience members move toward what is familiar and work to try to make sense of what is strange or unusual as they engage in the Playback Theatre event. This results in a participative (or anticipative) tension due to the interactive requirements of the form. This tension arises from the dynamic nature of the spectator-participant relationship (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 depicts the dynamic spectator-participant relationship linked by a bi-directional arrow. I have added *reflective distance* above the bi-directional arrow to capture what I have identified as a third dimension to audience engagement. This third dimension occurs in response to the spectator-participant dynamic and is intrinsic to audience members' engagement during the performance.

**PARTICIPANT**

Reflective distance refers to audience members' movement between the familiar role of spectator and the (less traditional) role of participant. Shifting between the two roles, audience members undertake a process of momentary distancing with the intention of re-engaging. While this has been more prevalent for those with no prior experience of Playback Theatre, the research found that most audience members experience reflective distancing at some stage during the performance. In an early reflective dialogue I comment:

It seems to me that they are constantly sitting there wondering if they'll say what's in their minds now. In this method we ask them to continually notice their responses. Every time they notice their response they have to make a decision about whether they're going to bring it out or not (OD07, L479).

This move to reflexive awareness could be understood in Turner's (1982) parlance. He proposes that during reflexive activity participants will experience an interruption to flow or a flow-break. The data drawn from the Playback Theatre performances featured herein suggest that reflective distance has elements of flow and, in fact, is intrinsic to audience members establishing flow. This is an important element of reflective distance and distinguishes it from those moments when an audience member might totally disengage. This notion of reflective distance aligns with Myerhoff's (1990) idea that audience members can experience flow while being simultaneously aware. The findings indicate that the ritual frames of Playback Theatre are more likely to induce flow experiences for audience members rather than the traditional trance-state often associated with ritual events and happenings. The experience of reflective distance is activated as audience members progress through what van Gennep (in Guss, 2001, Turner, 1969) names the "period of separation" where they move in time and space from the ordinary domestic domain to the heightened ritual domain (p.161). Next, I elaborate on the shift between the roles of spectator and participant into reflective distance during this period of initial engagement. Further exploration of the audience members' engagement in reflective distance is woven throughout the chapter.

Informants' responses suggest that reflective distance is linked to the expectations people have of the event. As suggested previously, audience members could have very little idea about what to expect at Playback Theatre performances (see DAW07, L120, for example). This immediately places those audience members in the position of needing to work out what is required as the performance progresses. In reflective distance, audience members gather information about what they are observing and experiencing particularly if it appears unfamiliar or unexpected. They then assess or weigh-up what they discover and come to some conclusion. This enables them to renegotiate their level of engagement in the Playback Theatre ritual in line with their new knowledge. This dynamic process occurs repeatedly and at all stages of the performance. It is like a metaphorical moment of moving away from the action when there are surprises or shifts in the form. This movement away accommodates the individual's thoughtful or reflective activity and acts to shift their attention away from the performative moment. Lack of certainty about the process and what is expected of them serves to distance audience members as they attempt to make sense of what is happening and work out how they can join in. The transcripts suggest that reflective distance could be ignited by an intuitive response to some incongruity in the shape of the performance or the integrity of the form (see for example, MDA14, L40). Surprises about the performers and a contradiction of the values implicit in the form could also activate reflective distance (see for example, Rec10, L12 & MDA14, L40 respectively).

In the initial stages, reflective distance is sparked by the degree to which the Playback Theatre performance has deviated from what the audience member has expected. Expectations may have been linked to the notion of the event as theatre, its purpose or context, and/or previous experiences of Playback Theatre. What audience members see and experience when they arrive at the performance immediately affects them. The following passage from Craig's observation notes evokes one description of what audience members have encountered on arriving at the Reconciliation performance.

There was a wonderful sense of community. There were people walking up, shaking hands, and introducing themselves. People felt very comfortable to do this. It wasn’t contrived and it wasn’t forced. That old guy, I noticed him all the time. He was ‘who are you?’ and he’d shake their hand and say this is who I am. … There was individuals, groups, couples … It reminded me of an old town public meeting, ‘let’s gather’ let's we - the community - gather, and let’s talk about what’s on. … There was a sense of event, but not in a traditional (theatre) sense. It even has its own rituals. It’s not like we’re going to see play [at] ‘the theatre’ [yet] there is a set of rituals that take place. [People created] their own set of rituals - introducing and getting coffee, sitting back, … almost like they were at home … and when the performance began, there was immediate silence when the actors entered (Craig, OD01, 224).

Craig's description and interpretation suggests that audience members' behaviour could influence what was perceived to be occurring. Here, the 'old guy' is seen shaking people's hands, welcoming them, perhaps evoking 'a wonderful sense of community' for Craig. The sense of community' and 'town meeting' ambience may have been equally derived from the welcoming and hosting done by the front of house51 personnel.

51 At this performance I organised an extra person to help out at front-of-house. This was partly so that the audience members would be well hosted and facilitated to complete the preliminary feedback page I was trialing for the research. Company member Rebecca and her friend Marion have a natural rapport with each other and this created a warm and welcoming feel at the door. They welcomed people and proceeded to explain various aspects of the event including an invitation to 'help themselves' to tea and coffee. It is my belief that these two women strongly influenced the opening ambience Craig described.

Informants have revealed that their initial engagement in the Playback Theatre ritual can initiate a process of making comparison between the (non-traditional) Playback Theatre event and what they have expected of a theatre experience. The following comment makes a particular comparison:

[U]nlike Playback I have to get a few drinks before I go and my colleague had to bully me into going … it was hideous, but it was hideously entertaining on a Friday night after a bottle of wine. Now I don't have to do that for Playback. You have to keep me away, I don't have to drink a bottle of wine to be engaged, but I'm not

'entertained', I'm 'engaged.' … There's something that nourishes the soul in this method, and it nourishes the communal soul of the group that's there for the evening, with the recognition and respect of a fundamental human process and that is, that you are *feeling* life. So it's like poetry and art. [My] feeling life is touched.

In the other kind of performance [my] feeling life can be touched too, but it's in a very caricatured, contrived way (Asha, Mar03, L125).

In this excerpt, Asha (an experienced Playback Theatre audience member) makes a comparison between Playback Theatre and a night at a specific kind of conventional theatre.

She states that, for her, conventional theatre lacks what she requires or desires for 'engagement'. Playback Theatre offers nourishment for both her's and the communal soul.

This act of comparing or analysing the performance by an audience member aligns with Coppieters' (in Bennett, 1990) finding regarding audiences at nontraditional theatre events. He claims that audiences engage in a meta-process as they participate and tend to be particularly aware of how the nontraditional event differs from what they had come to expect of a traditional theatre event. Interview data suggests that this is particularly so for first time audience members.

The deviation of Playback Theatre from a conventional theatre experience has presented various challenges for audience members depending on their expectations, and their previous experiences of non-traditional or interactive theatre performances. For some it has been confronting, as the following comment shows:

I wasn't used to that kind of theatre. I found it quite confronting that this was on an emotional level … I was watching, looking back to see whose story it was,

seeing if they were reacting in the right way, the traditional way, and that was good.

I was trying to understand what was going on. I got more involved, got more carried away, with some of the longer stories at the end where they developed a diverse look at the issues (Eloise, Rec01, L35).

In this comment made immediately after the reconciliation performance, Eloise explains the process she undertook to neutralise some of her discomfort while becoming familiar with the form. She states that she was 'watching, looking back' at the storyteller. She acknowledges that she was 'trying to understand what was going on' and that eventually she has been 'carried away'. Observation data suggest that audience members are constantly engaged in watching, As soon as a person speaks, that's where the focus of the audience goes. [They]

turn around and look. [They] don’t' just sit out front and hear the story, they turn around and make that connection with who is speaking (Craig, OD01, L512).

Eloise's experience early in the performance could signal the separation phase that ritual theory reports, where participants move toward the heightened world of the ritual performance away from the ordinary or the everyday, or in this case familiar theatre experience (see for example, Guss, 2001, Turner, 1969, 1982). It is when audience members cross this threshold Schechner (1985) claims, that the performance comes to life and succeeds.

Eloise's comment shows her movement to reflective distance. She does this by way of observing the process and assessing the consequences of participation on others. In her reflective role she is able to look 'at the people' and ascertain that after their stories are enacted they look 'really relieved' (Rec01, L245). This comment suggests that Eloise is gathering information about the unfamiliar form. She has then been able to surrender or renegotiate her expectations of this theatre event and her idea about what constitutes performance or public gatherings and move toward being more involved. In the excerpt Eloise describes her entry into the liminal zone. She states that at some point she is carried away. She has been able to overcome her sense of repulsion from or caution with what is different about this event. She has become free to enter the liminal space of the theatre event as an engaged spectator.

Further discussion of audience members' experience of the liminal dimension of Playback Theatre occurs later in the chapter.

Another adjustment or comparison for audience members as they engage in the Playback Theatre form for the first time concerns the way in which their behavior differs from how they might behave in other public forums. For instance,

[It was] challenging for me, overcoming stage fright. [I found] myself thinking about whether I would participate. I am not a shy person either, I am usually comfortable talking with audiences … that's part of my role (Ariel, MDA01, L10).

Ariel's comment suggests that Playback Theatre is a contradictory public social environment. Observing the reconciliation performance, Craig proposes that the ambience is suggestive of a private social environment. During a co-observer dialogue he refers to the ambience and structure of the event as being like an 'animated dinner party conversation' (OD01, L230).

This aggregation of various social environments is confusing and challenging for some invoking a reflective response.

The process of reflective distancing continues as the performance progresses. Audience members engage in analysis about the production of the enactment (Jul05, L218), the position and use of stories (DAW07, L15), the tellers (DAW06, L235), the performers (Rec03, L169), the use of theatrical devices such as music, props, space and style (Rec09a, L67, MHW04, L1033), and the magical or mystical dimension (Pride04, L86). Engagement in reflective distance is central to the way in which the audience moves toward or away from participating in the ritual process. The tension within individuals as they undertake the shift from the recognisable spectator role to the possible participant role provides something extra in the performance. In the next section, I present the data on audience members' experience of the Playback Theatre ritual as a potential forum for participation.

**6.2** **Participating**

The possibility of participating in the Playback Theatre ritual presents a significant focus for audience members. As I suggest above the interactive nature of Playback Theatre is often a surprise for them. This results in audience members undergoing a process of preparing to participate. Interview and reflective data suggest that various elements influence the individual audience member's capacity and desire to participate. In this section, I present what I have discovered about the primary way in which audience members participate at the Playback Theatre event through the telling of their personal story. I consider the experiences of audience members when they are deciding whether to tell a story, the experiences of audience members who choose to tell and the experiences of audience members who choose not to tell.

I discuss those elements that assist audience members to participate and those things that impede participation. I also report on the other ways audience members participate in the performances that are featured in the study.

**6.2.1 Preparing to participate**

Interview transcripts suggest that audience members undertake a process of consenting to participate or finding a preparedness to tell. This process enables audience members to occupy the second stage of van Gennep's (in Turner, 1969) ritual framework, and enter the liminal activity of Playback Theatre more fully. The most obvious position from which to participate in the Playback Theatre ritual is as a storyteller. In the Playback Theatre literature there is a good deal of interest in the audience participant who tells. This individual speaks aloud from the group, either seated amongst them or on stage alongside the conductor. Both sites of telling require the audience participant to assume a more direct performative role in the event. They step out, into the private/public threshold, bringing with them the content that will form the basis of the next dramatic display. This performative role involves audience-player52 interaction in the production of the theatre event.While this transition and subsequent participation in the performance is somewhat central to the Playback Theatre method, it is in no way unique in storytelling theatre traditions (Denzin, 1989). There is an invitation implicit in the form and the invitation is also made repeatedly by the conductor during the

52 Player in this context refers to the playback theatre performer on-stage in the event.

performance. Over the course of the study, I have discovered that there are a number of possible responses to the invitation to tell a story at Playback Theatre.

One response to the invitation to tell a story is for audience members to simply decide to join in. Informants who have made a conscious decision suggest that they felt a certain amount of ease with what they observed and experienced early in the ritual and came to understand that participation is a fundamental element of the form. For instance,

I really felt that if I was at Playback and this was how it was that I should participate because it depends on people's stories (Vickie, Jul04, L12).

Rather than this being a decision to tell a story it suggests a decision to participate or a personal commitment to accepting what is being offered through the form. Karp (1994) would say that participants who readily adapt to participating like this have a high degree of spontaneity. That is, it is likely that what they observe and experience does not create anxiety or fear in the participant, and thus, they are open to saying, 'Yes' to the invitations implicit in the form.

Some informants' responses indicate a lack of ease with the values they have observed or experienced as implicit in the Playback Theatre performance. This can lead to a high level of discomfort with the requirements of participation, particularly with respect to the centrality of personal story and the risks implicit in self-disclosure in a public setting. One informant cites her experiences as a writer as the reason she felt strongly resistant to participating in the performance she attended. She states that her belief as a writer is that she *owns* the story and that the personal story in Playback Theatre is the same as her authored work. As such, she claims that the teller should have both artistic license and self-responsibility. She states that she felt that the teller is abdicating their responsibility for dealing with their issues by telling their story in public (Elizabeth, Rec10, L31), a view that contradicts what Denzin (1989)

claims. He asserts that when one reveals their past to others they are taking "responsibility for their actions" (p.132).

In the two examples above, it is the way in which the participants' values interact with the values implicit in the Playback Theatre process that determines whether they moved toward (Vickie) or away (Elizabeth) from participating. Using Csikszentmihalyi's (1997) framework, it is likely that Elizabeth has been aroused by the challenges present in the Playback Theatre ritual, however the values conflict she has experienced is too great an obstacle for her to overcome and therefore has acted to impede or limit her capacity or desire to participate. Her continued lack of engagement is a consequence of this dynamic and has acted as a barrier to the flow experience for her. She states, 'I could never do that'. Further, Elizabeth does not appear to be invested in the success of the performance. Interactive and participatory theatre audience often enjoy the authority they have to direct the action. This confers on them an ownership over the process or a particular closeness to the process (O'Toole & Lepp, 2000) that was not evident in Elizabeth's comments. Later in the section I explore barriers to participation further. Meanwhile I present data from audience members who did experience a desire or in some cases a compulsion to participate.

**6.2.2 Feeling compelled to participate**

Beyond the barrier that Elizabeth has encountered, informants' experiences of Playback Theatre seem to make some logical sense to them and appear congruent with their values.

Individual and discussion group interviews indicate that participants have commonly experienced their memories and stories surfacing during the Playback Theatre performance. In this way, participating could be considered a 'response' to the ritual structure inherent in the Playback Theatre form. The persistent invitation to tell a story by the conductor coupled with what is depicted through the stories and enactments draws audience members into the ritual in such a way that some have felt compelled to tell, as the following example demonstrates.

Helen reveals that she was strongly engaged by the first words of the night, 'I don't believe I have to say sorry. I've not done anything wrong' (RecVT, L39). During my after-show conversation with her, she reflects on how this statement affected her and resulted in her sharing her response during the performance. She says:

I thought 'oh it'll go away' [laugh] but then it was too insistent, I could feel it, I

can't remember how, but I was connecting with other responses. I thought 'I *have* to say something.' … I couldn't hold it anymore (Helen, Rec07, L38).

Helen's experience of an insistent desire to speak has compelled her to share her feeling early in the performance. This experience can be aligned with what Schechner suggests occurs between the audience and the performer. He states that audience members play an integral part in the performance and that this relationship generates a level of intensity that enables participants to enter the liminal zone. Not all audience participants have the opportunity to share their experience each time it arises in a Playback Theatre performance. The transcripts reveal numerous references to participants experiencing a repeated urge to tell during a performance. Some of these participants admit that they tried to resist the urge. For example: I could have shared constantly, but I thought I shouldn't. Just about the travels through life, a million stories came into my head (Maxine, Jul01, L42, see also

Jul03, L42, MHW01, L27).

The reasons individuals give for not telling at this point is again aligned with their specific values. Many of the reasons are linked to the way in which they see the performance as a forum for self-expression, promoting diversity and inclusion – values that underpin the contexts in which the performances feature, for example, mental health sector, disability advocacy, refugee and asylum seeker empowerment. Participants have engaged in reflective distancing to manage their desire to tell. Similarly, at the Reconciliation performance potential storytellers have engaged in the assessment of the context and the audience as they negotiated whether to tell their story. For instance, 'My story didn't fit … it had nothing to do with reconciliation' (Jude, Rec04, L59). In another example prospective storyteller, Phoebe,

questions whether she had a right to tell in what she saw as a time-limited and theme-specific forum dedicated to Australian Aboriginal reconciliation (Phoebe, Rec06, L203).

The constant negotiation of whether to tell or not to tell acts to move participants in and out of reflective distance. Often the urge to tell dissipates as the audience member concerned watches the next story. However, audience members also discuss the experience of the ongoing awakening of images or glimpses of stories as the ritual has proceeded. The repeated recalling of stories and desire to tell them can be explained using Csikszentmihalyi's (1997) concept of flow. At any given moment, audience members feel that they are capable of meeting the challenge (or of responding to the invitation) to participate. This sustained engagement in the process through awakening stories and a desire to tell them can also be understood in terms of Spolin's (1999) theory of improvised performance. She states that when performers or those preparing to perform (or tell their stories) are open to the moment, they become free to relate and to act. As the performer feels this freedom, the desire to relate and act is further enhanced. It is as if the openness of the stage and the presence of the actors transform the invitation to tell into an irresistible desire to act.

The urge to tell continues to build as the performance progresses for some audience members. One example of this is Kylie's experience. The final teller at the Reconciliation performance, Kylie has waited through the entire show with a growing desire to tell her story. She acknowledges that as the performance proceeded, what she has seen and heard has influenced her and changed her story somewhat. However, her urge to tell did not abate. Speaking with me later, she recounts the process leading up to her decision to tell her story/ies. 'In the first 5 minutes I had a lot of emotional responses. Some of the things got me angry. It was a real gamut of responses' (Kylie, Rec09a, L29). She lists the stories that came before hers and speaks about the ways in which each one added to her growing desire to tell. This has resulted in Kylie experiencing a number of moves across her threshold toward flow and back again.

The momentum that built as she chose not to act on her urge to speakout was finally expressed in what I have experienced as a somewhat detailed but confused telling of her story toward the end of the performance (RecVT, L486). A number of audience members' responses to this telling are reported later in the chapter.

Audience members' experiences of oscillating toward and away from telling appear to manifest as unexpressed tension in the early part of the performance. One audience member describes the move beyond this tension in the following way:

I was sitting there thinking that everyone was really uptight and then it reaches a critical point and 'woosh!' the audience opened up (Eloise, Rec01, L50).

This 'woosh' moment may point to a time in the process where newcomers to the form begin to make sense of the ritual process, and begin to determine the way in which they will engage or 'open up' as suggested above. During an observation dialogue, Craig spoke of this moment as the audience loosening up. He remarks, 'It's like the pressure has been lifted' (OD01, L576). The inference of mutuality and collectivity in the 'woosh' moment can be interpreted in terms of communitas (Turner, 1982) for the group. At this point, it appears that there is a collective move into the liminal zone of the ritual. A discussion among reflective partners (OD01, L848) raises concerns about the way teller autonomy or agency could be muted at this point. Craig deems it unlikely that a storyteller would feel comfortable reneging on their offer to tell once they are on stage during the Playback Theatre performance. On Louella's suggestion that tellers would self regulate, Craig counters that the desire to renege may coincide with the enactment rather than the telling. He questions whether there is 'permission' in the form to interrupt the enactment. Individual audience interviews from the Refugee Week performance raise a similar concern suggesting instead that tellers are or become vulnerable on stage, or could feel pressured to tell. This is discussed later in the chapter.

**6.2.3 From audience to stage: deciding to tell**

Participants who speak about the gradual building of the urge to tell reveal a complex inner dialogue about whether or not to do more with the dynamic internal experience of the story that has been awoken. Different words are used to describe the process of a story emerging: stories 'percolated' (Darren, Rec05, L416), 'bubbled' (Sebastian, Jul05, L271), and 'were triggered' (Bea, Rec01, L193), stories 'came up', 'came forward,' and 'burst' out. Informants who have told stories during the performances have discussed their experience of deciding that they would share the story that had bubbled to the surface. This process appears to require the teller to rally a number of reasons as to why they would act on their desire to tell. These reasons may not necessarily be conscious at the time but are made conscious through the reflective process that has emerged in response to the research.

One view expressed suggests that some tellers feel at ease once they have identified that they want to tell a story. For example, 'There was a point when the other woman spoke her story out I started to feel firm that there was a story for me and I wanted to tell it' (Anthony, Rec11, L11). Another view suggests that the decision is a conscious act to claim their right to tell. For example, Kylie says she thought, 'I can experience that. While I might only be young I do have a story to tell' (Kylie, Rec03, L159). During an interview, one audience member reveals that she became aware during the show that she had been sitting there thinking who she would cast to play her if she volunteered to tell her story (OD06, L456). While another view indicates that tellers engage in an elaborate internal dialogue before they feel able to act on the persistence of their desire to tell their story. What emerges from the interviews with tellers is that their decision to tell come after they have identified sufficient reasons to justify their action. Next, I recount Hillary's process of electing to come on stage to tell a story that was about to burst forth from her.

It is likely that Hillary arrived at the Mental Health Week performance with her stories somewhat present due to her high level of engagement in the context53. She claims that she became aware of a story she could tell early in the performance and as the performance got more underway, she has *decided* to tell. Hillary speaks about her motivation to tell being linked to what she would gain, and what it would do for others. She has wanted to 'grab the opportunity' for herself and on behalf of others. She says:

When you used the Playback Theatre as a way of verbalising and showing, wow! [I thought], this is going to do a lot for me. I was going to grab the opportunity, if nobody else is. If they didn’t have the courage to do so. … There are so many other people in a similar position as myself that care for someone who's mentally ill and I thought, 'I have got that courage to speak up, and they too get heard.'

That's where the carers on Consumer Advisory Group54 can get involved. That's why I'm here (Hillary, DAW04, L138).

While these reasons enable her to move toward telling her story, she later admits to another motive for telling. She says, 'In the back of mind I was thinking this is the safest place it will ever be for Nathaniel55 to hear this' (Hillary, MHW06, L386).

Hillary's experience could be discussed in terms of Heidegger's (in Denzin, 1989) thesis. He reminds us that we are talking beings and as such we tell our stories to become who we are. In her experience of telling, Hillary doubles herself. She becomes a second self who while lodged in the past is telling in the present. Denzin suggests that at this point there are multiple selves of the teller speaking (Denzin, 1989). From these active and activated selves Hillary sat in the audience. The following excerpts recount her process of preparing to tell her story:

I was very overwhelmed to begin with. I was thinking 'how can you possibly reflect this story that we (I) have so heartfelt, inside our bellies (my belly) that makes us

(me) feel the way we (I) do, and express it, like that, in all these little stories.' [So at that moment] I was thinking 'they can do this (the little stories), can they do that

(my heartfelt-inside-my-belly-story)?' In a way, those first few stories were weaving the test of you. [As I watched] I thought, 'OK, they got part of it right, pretty well - and I had doubted you would get it right - [it was] close enough. You were touching (on) everything. That was great.

53 The relationship between participation and context is discussed in Chapter 5.

54 The Consumer Advisory Group was the name given to the group of people who "advised" Community Health bodies and the State Health Authority on the points of views of consumers with respect to mental health policy. Consumers in this group included both individuals with mental illness and carers. 55 Nathaniel is the storyteller's brother. His experience of this is reported later in the chapter.

[And as I sat there, I was thinking,] 'There are a huge amount of carers here.

They're all very, very tired, because we've dealt with things, we're dealing with things, it's ongoing.' Then I thought, 'It's going well. Now, what's going to happen next?

You had that space for people to decide whether or not they wanted their story to be out there. I had heavy legs, and inside was about the burst, whether I was going to run away or run up to you [laughs]. It was a pretty shaky moment. But once I got up, I could feel the strength of others, especially the CAG56 group, they have a lot of faith in me, and I thought, 'Go for it Hillary!' And then comes telling the story (Hillary, MHW04, L212).

In order to cross the threshold into the liminal activity of the performance, Hillary rallies her various selves. Gathering herself together as she does is a step toward flow. She becomes, in Csikszentmihalyi's (1992) words, "master" of her own "fate" (p.3). As she announces, she decided to 'go for it!' Hillary 's decision to tell her story has been mediated by the conditions present at the time. It is not clear however whether the performance ritual has *created* the conditions that enable her to tell or whether the performance has *met* the conditions that she intuitively knows are necessary if she is to tell her personal story in public. When the performance does not meet these conditions, persistently urgent stories can remain untold, as is explored in the following section.

**6.2.4 A story left untold**

As illustrated by Hillary 's experience participants can engage in a complex inner process in and out of reflective distance – in and out of flow – about whether or not to tell their story. Discussion group transcripts reveal that there are times when persistent stories are left untold at the end of the performance because the audience member concerned does not experience the combined conditions required for them to surrender to the ritual moment. Informants reveal that a decision not to tell can be linked to a number of factors: the participant's reading of and comfort with the venue and the audience, the participant's relationship to the context, and the participant's overall expectations of the event. The following account of Darren's

56 CAG is the acronym for the Consumer Advisory Group. Hillary and Nathaniel are members and were involved in the compilation of the Recovery Kit that was launched at the Mental Health Week performance.

experience encompasses the way in which these factors have interacted to influence his decision about whether he would tell his story. When Darren 's story is triggered it is totally unexpected and surprises him considerably. He says:

I entered with the idea that I didn't have any experiences that related to the theme.

Then had a whole lot of things go 'Bop! Bop! Bop!' (a sound representing each story). That really struck me about the night, we were telling stories like when a bunch of people sits around a table. It was a dynamic process. … I had a bunch of things come up - personal stories - and I didn’t really know there were issues there (Darren, Rec05, L355, L372).

Darren suggests that the liminal intensity sparked his stories. While the emergence of his story has been a surprise Darren reports that a number of other dimensions of the event were not as he expected. For instance,

The thing that struck me was that, there were three women on stage, or four women on stage, and two of them were older women, and I was quite surprised by that … I was expecting a different venue. Some place more neutral. [When] I came in and realised that it was a community … I felt really apart from that, and that worked against me feeling at home because a lot of people seemed to know each other and I didn't know anyone. I found myself doing some social-environmental

(analysis), who are these people? I felt quite outside. And I was expecting to see

Hanna57 there, and she wasn’t (Darren, Rec05, L297).

Darren admits that he met with a series of surprises: neither the venue and the ensemble were what he had expected, the audience appeared to know one another, he felt excluded, the familiar face he had expected to see in Hanna's, was not there. In a reflective discussion, Craig comments on the audience in a similar way, he notes that some appeared unusually familiar, like 'guests', where others appeared less at ease, like 'roll ups' (OD01, L146). It is likely that the number of surprises Darren encounters results in his being unable to respond adequately to the repetitive presentation of new situations as they came to light. This could be interpreted as what Karp (1994) calls low spontaneity or a loss of spontaneity. Indeed the uncertainty and possible anxiety Darren experiences as he encounters repeated surprises could have acted to immediately lower his spontaneity and lower the potential for him to enter the liminal activity.

57 Hanna is a Brisbane Playback Theatre Company member. She personally invited Darren to the performance and part of his motivation to come was linked to seeing her perform. She had withdrawn from the performance due to illness.

Under these conditions there has been little likelihood of him having a flow experience. While I was unaware of Darren's dis-ease during the performance, some weeks later in the course of my reflective writing, I have become aware of the recurrent appearance of children in the stories at the reconciliation performance. It is probable that the final two stories have coincided approximately with the time Darren's story became persistent. The storytellers both began their stories from a childhood memory, however the focus of both was their adult experience. As such, the actors have done little with the material featuring them as children. Instead, they have focused on the details of the adult in the enactment. Darren's story featured him as a child. The increasing persistence of his story could be explained by the lack of attention to what Zánkay (1999) calls the "contravening forces" present in the two other stories (p.192). It is possible that Darren may have felt some easing of his inner conflict if the child-specific content of these stories had been evoked symbolically in relation to the adult content. Embodying the childhood dimension in the enactment could result in Darren releasing some of the intensity that was building around his story. The inclusion of this content in the dramatisation would succeed only if the enactment has captured the symbolic link that has caused the tellers to bring their childhood into the story in the first place.

Alternatively, as conductor I could have acknowledged that children or childhood has emerged in both stories yet has not been prominent and specifically invited a story about childhood to bring this less emphasised perspective onto stage.

There are many factors impinging on Darren's capacity to relax and be involved. His experience suggests that when a story is activated and the conditions to tell that story have not been established the participant may engage in an assessment of the factors in the environment. Darren's experience of continually discovering elements that were not as he had expected: the venue, the composition of the audience, the composition of the performing ensemble (including his expectation that his friend would be performing), and the style of acting has hindered Darren's capacity and desire to participate. Nevertheless, he has experienced his story as persistent and continued in his internal process of deciding whether to tell it in this context. When describing the experience, Darren says that his 'story was confusing' and contained complicated subject matter. In addition he decided that 'it might be too long' (Darren, Rec03, L188). As the performance has progressed, he has continued to resist the urge to tell his story. When speaking with him later, he recounts how he felt disappointed that he did not tell his story and admits that his resistance had remained strong throughout the show. His intense inner turmoil eases when he shares his experience with others in the after-show discussion group. He speaks of this experience:

Our discussion really helped me balance it, to collect other people’s impressions,

and to compare with mine. There were really strong recurring things, we were all full of stories and to express them was helpful (Darren, Rec05, L368)

Darren was still integrating the incongruency he had experienced between what he expected and what he encountered. His continual shifting in and out of reflective distance equates to repeated flow-breaks and has dominated his experience of the performance. His comment suggests that the period immediately following the performance has contained him in some ritualised way. This after-show period is a regular part of the Playback Theatre ritual. The discussion group interviews that have been facilitated and audio-taped immediately after the performances reveal that during this period people tell the stories they did not or could not tell during the performance. This is explored further in the next chapter as *Post-Performance*.

Darren's experience demonstrates how the simultaneous occurrence of a number of factors compounds to reinforce his resistance to telling and inhibit his participation and his experiences of flow. As suggested earlier, other informants also report *choosing* not to tell their stories. Interview transcripts reveal that audience members might regulate their involvement due to social protocols they recognise as intrinsic to the ritual. For example:

I was aware that my-age of white women were keen to speak up. I didn’t have anything new to add [to what they had said]. I was hoping to hear diverse voices (Katie, MDA10, L25).

This comment suggests that people choose not to tell because their personal values direct them to 'leave space' for others (Maxine, Jul03, L42). Audience members admit to having a story they could have told if it had been required (Gerard, MHW04, L897). These audience members found themselves 'sitting back' because they 'could see there were others who were *trying* to say something' (Leda, MDA03, L74, my emphasis) or who *needed* to tell their story more than they did (Joss, MHW04, L827, my emphasis).

Thus, this action of leaving spaces for others is often linked to individual's rationalising that 'others' are more deserving of the opportunity to tell. However, a number of informant interviews reveal that there has been anti-oppressive values guiding the choice to resist telling.

This is particularly evident in the Mental Health Week and Refugee Week performances. It also emerges in the reconciliation performance in terms of wanting to honour the space as a discussion for the 'Australian aborigine' story. One teller has revealed her reluctance to tell her story about her Cherokee heritage because she wanted to respect the intention of the performance and not 'usurp the Aboriginal story.' She says she found herself asking, 'is it appropriate' for me to tell my story (Phoebe, Rec06, L203).

**6.2.5 Barriers to participation**

Through Darren's story above, I have explored various elements that conspired to impede his participation. Other blocks to spontaneity are linked to audience members' familiarity with the ritual process. As was suggested earlier in the chapter, audience members who are new to Playback Theatre often find that a greater part of their initial engagement is dedicated to 'getting it' (Clare, DAW06, L854). Observation notes report how audience members watch early storytellers with a curiosity (OD01, L83). Clare's experience is presented below and suggests that being unfamiliar with the form can inhibit participation and enjoyment and that a growing familiarity brings ease:

At first we didn't know what to expect. We watched and tried to catch on. I really started to get into the last part of it. The beginning was confusing. We didn't know what to expect or what to think. We had to wait and see. We started getting into it more toward the end … After a while, when I realised that I wasn't going to have to speak, or be made to, and that I could watch other people's stories I was OK.

But for quite a while I was worried I would be picked out (Clare, DAW05, L7, L38).

This correlates to what Johnstone (1981) claims with respect to freeing people to participate in improvised performance. He suggests that knowing the rules helps people to relax and join in. The ambivalence around participating expressed in Clare's and Darren's comments aligns with what Coppieters (in Bennett, 1990) discusses about audience members at non-traditional theatre events. The ritual rhythm of the performance works to destabilise the social structures and impel audience members to enter the liminal activity. The unexpected momentum of this can trigger strong resistance in some.

Through the course of the study, I have noticed that feeling unfamiliar with the ritual process or rules of engagement coupled with anxiety about performing has acted to inhibit audience members' participation. This has been particularly true for those attending the Mental Health Week performance. Effort had been invested in ensuring that the event would be well supported by the wider context. The timing and placement of the event was such that it enhanced the access of many people with an interest in mental health issues58. Before the scheduled start of the performance, the MC introduced a guest from the government. This is in keeping with the protocol expected for community events funded by government bodies. For the audience, this has signaled the start of the event. Joss best articulates the way in which those with a mental illness received the opening address. She says:

58 Mental Health Week is promoted through a national awareness campaign and supported through designated funding programs. The regional mental health network responsible for this performance generated significant interest in the event.

You know, as someone who works with consumers (people living with mental illness) all week, I could see they were thinking, 'What *is* this crock of shit?' Who are all these people, and where are they on (other) Tuesdays? Most of the consumers are sitting on the cement out there, and the others are standing around or walking around and looking down on the consumers. I just found the experience so patronising toward the consumers and completely unconnected to the people it was supposed to be all about (Joss, MHW04, L688).

Here Joss is suggesting that the challenge presented by the forum was simply too hard for audience members with mental illness. The factors inhibiting their participation have extended to the complete exclusion of them through the alienating performance of the politicians.

Rather than sit in the audience and worry or become anxious or bored they have excluded themselves altogether from the activity. My own experience of this has been equally alienating.

The government official went well overtime. Backstage, the actors and I were waiting to go on. We had little clue as to why there was a delay and could not hear what was being said. As conductor, I have responded to my own feelings of isolation due to the delayed start by commencing the Playback Theatre session with a story from my own life that is relevant to the context. Some audience members comment that this has helped them to move toward participation59. But for the consumers, already outside on the pavement, it has made no difference.

Transcripts from a number of interviews reveal that unexpected elements within the performance can hinder audience members' desire to participate. For example, Bea found that she and her partner have been hampered by the presence of a distressed baby when they tried to engage at the Pride performance. She says:

We were sitting where the baby and all the family were sitting. The noise was very loud for us, because we were right behind them. My anxiety was associated with a concern that they (the performers) can't hear, they're not going to get it and …

they're not going to create the environment for that depth that's needed for sharing (Bea, Pride02, L195).

Co-observation data also notes the impact of the baby. Dawn's observation notes report that one of the baby's parents 'actually went out, shut the door and tried to settle him'. However,

59 Further discussion about the influence of the conductor is incorporated in section on *Seeing Others.*

people were still looking around to see 'what are they doing now?' (Dawn, OD2, L594). As conductor I have also been very aware of the baby and have eventually invited one of his mothers, who by now is walking him back and forward at the end of the room, to share her experience. My intention has been to transform the surreptitious efforts of his mother to quieten him by facilitating a public acknowledgement of his presence. While this may have assisted his mother to participate, it did not seem to assist those audience members alienated by the presence of the baby to overcome their distance.

Another barrier to participation is linked to audience members' fear of being exposed. Jackie speaks of the presence of her ex-partner in the audience and indicates that her fear of being exposed has inhibited her participation. She has come to the performance with a number of friends. When she has arrived she has discovered other friends and her ex-partner there. She becomes concerned that her ex-partner could undermine her privacy and tell a story that features her (Pride04, L15). Her concern about being exposed by her ex-partner has distracted her for the early part of the show and limited her capacity to be involved. She reports that she became aware of 'sitting on myself [and] when someone got up to tell a story I realised that I wouldn't tell a story (Jackie, Pride 04, L28).

An alternative view expressed about exposure concerns the risk or possibility of an audience member telling too much. This is demonstrated in Louella's comments:

With someone like me, sometimes stuff might come out [laughs nervously] that I didn’t actually mean to come out. If I was sitting there with you and I had a connection with you, I might say a little bit more than I would usually and it might come out. Then afterwards I might think, ‘maybe I shouldn’t have said all that’ but then maybe, I know it sounds mixed, but maybe subconsciously we self regulate

(Louella, OD01, L882).

Louella's comment suggests that sitting adjacent to the conductor could lead to a teller saying more than they are comfortable with. There is no data from these performances to suggest any of the storytellers thought that they said too much. Helen acknowledges that seeing the intensity of her emotion expressed on stage was a little unsettling and Vickie speaks of her embarrassment. She says:

It was an accurate portrayal of my story, embarrassingly so. That's what I was like and I thought, 'oh my God, I was like that!' It was great though, it was like looking at a photo album that moves, you know, seeing yourself again and remembering what you were like (Vickie, Jul04, L15).

Vickie has been struck by seeing what she might have been like as a teenager. She does not appear to be concerned about what others are seeing or that she might have told too much. As conductor there have been occasions when I have been aware that a teller might be unable to self-regulate as they told their story. This has occurred at the Mental Health Week performance when Hillary came to the stage. In this instance, I have noticed that she was already teary and in conducting her, I created a rhythm that made spaces for her to feel the emotion that was embedded in the memories she was recalling as she relayed her story. Hillary's response to telling her story is reported later in the thesis.

The conscious effort by audience members to avoid exposure has led several people to actively suppress their stories. For instance:

I found myself trying not to think of a story, because I knew as soon as I started thinking about something I’d want to stick my hand up and then I’d have to say something. The (idea of) exposure was too much (Sebastian, Jul05, L262)

As the ritual continued Sebastian's strong resistance softened and as he became more comfortable he dared to notice his story:

I did actually have a story in the end, the person who was facilitating talked about that bubbling up and I did actually get that and I was about to put my hand up

(Sebastian, Jul05, L265)

Sebastian is reluctant to be noticed. Other audience members have invested time in deciding where they would sit to minimise the likelihood of being invited and possibly exposed. Co-observers notice the arrival of a group of women. 'One woman suggested to sit in the second row but her friends were very reluctant to sit that close … It was like they didn't want to be seen, they wanted to hide' (Craig, OD01, L261). Other audience members express their relief at not being chosen, or when someone nearby has made a contribution. Eloise said:

It seemed like stories were coming from all around the place, so that made me feel comfortable, especially when Sarah spoke I thought OK we’ve done our bit

(Eloise, Rec01, L281)

Fear of exposure has been taken to another level at the Refugee Week performance. Some time into the performance I have expressed my intention to include a range of voices. I have been particularly aware that there are a number of people with refugee and asylum seeker experience in the audience. A number of comments are made in relation to the fact that I have specifically invited a man from the audience to tell his story. Initially he has declined. After the next story, he has signaled to me that he would now like to tell his story. He has spoken of his treatment at the hands of the Australian government due in part to his physical disability. A number of workers in the refugee sector have later criticised me for putting him at risk explaining the complexity of speaking in public for refugee and asylum seeker audience members. For example:

Asylum seekers are so vulnerable. [This man] is disabled, a refugee and African. He is very vulnerable. He doesn't know the audience, he doesn't have any feeling of trust in his life yet, doesn't know how he can entrust his story. I am his caseworker and it still takes time. There is the language problems, and his anxiety. Refugees all have disempowered status whether they have a visa, or are temporary protection visa holders, they are under consideration, and everything you say in public could go back in weird and wonderful ways to the powers-to-be. They don't even know what to say, or when to keep quiet … They have no voice, or they are not heard -

the government doesn't listen, the community doesn't hear, the media misinterpret, and misunderstand. You are familiar with expressing yourself. You've gone through the rigours of how to speak out or how to be heard. From where asylum seekers come from they were punished for using their voice, by the government,

the media, their neighbours (Ariel, MDA01, L35).

This perspective is strongly influenced by Ariel's values and experience in this context. This coincides with Wolff's (in Bennett, 1990) proposal that audience members engage with the theatre experience from their unique perspective frameworks and that socially formed values and personal ideas influence their perception. Holding these views in the ritual space offered by the Playback Theatre performance has created a tension between (the socially formed value that encouraged) the protection of refugees and (the value implicit in Playback Theatre that advocated) participation by refugees. Turner would suggest that the ritual frame is inviting the audience to undermine tradition, and in Carlson's (1996) view, enable them to explore fresh and alternative structures for behaviour with respect to interactions among the various audience members. This concern about and subsequent desire to block (protect) refugee tellers led to professionals at this performance being preoccupied with maintaining the social order. This has resulted in continuing and ongoing flow breaks for them and thus, the blocking of their own participation.

Ariel expresses the vulnerability of the man I invited using a series of labels: disabled, refugee, African. Other comments made after the Refugee Week performance reinforce to me the extent to which he may have been vulnerable. Most notably the experience refugees have of repeatedly telling their story, where they come to understand this act as a kind of currency. Each telling promises a move along the continuum from refugee to resident (Nina, MDA13, L21). Ariel suggests that the public and creative dimensions in the event introduced additional issues for refugee. She states that the refugee teller's story 'may not come out how they want' due to English-as-a-second language and performance anxiety. Perhaps more difficult is the likelihood that the telling would be heard out of context, and the refugee teller would be unable to provide adequate context (because it is too hard/complex/painful to elaborate on). This complexity may then lead to something 'very integral' missing from the tale and increase the risk of the refugee-teller being misrepresented (Ariel, MDA01, L16).

Fear of exposing another has inhibited participation. For example, concern for how the story she wanted to tell would compromise her husband's public image inhibited Clare telling a story at the Disability Action Week performance where there were a number of his colleagues in the audience. She explains:

My husband works at (the local rail authority), he has quadriplegia and he was involved in the disability committee there. So, we came along. … I did think of telling about us meeting, but I was worried about how far to go. I was worried that my partner might feel embarrassed or threatened (exposed) having me talk about our private life. I spoke to him about it later and he said he would have been OK with it, but was glad that I didn't because he might have gotten worried about what his colleagues would think (Clare, DAW05, L3, L20).

This level of self-regulation interferes with a participant's capacity to enter the liminal zone and achieve flow. Rather than it being the degree of difficulty of the task, social protocol factors have conspired to inhibit Clare. Despite the public ritual invoking her domestic tale, she has felt reluctant to breach her established public protocols for fear it would impact on her husband's public realm and her (and his) domestic realm. Fear or uncertainty of the possible consequences inhibited Clare's spontaneous involvement and has created a tension between her intuitive responses and her usual responses. Self-regulation such as Clare demonstrates occurs to minimise the likelihood of exposure. The fear of exposing another has hindered her capacity to participate. This finding concurs with what Johnstone (1981) writes about the importance of coming to know the rules that frame the activity. In the repetition of the Playback Theatre ritual process Clare is able to come to know the rules and enter the ritual. While Clare chooses not to share her story, she does, as Turner (1981) and Schechner (1985) state, begin to move beyond the domestic constraints of her roles and consider engaging in new ways with herself, her husband and the social environment.

It could be argued that Clare's social role (as wife) has constrained her capacity to participate. Observation data reveal that one's professional role could pose as a barrier to participation. One example of this has occurred at the Mental Health Week performance. In recounting her experience of the performance Arlene speaks about the conflict between her professional self and her private concern as she sat in the audience. She states,

In my job, I am in a distant role, helping people with practical things. I feel such empathy, and people's stories touch my life but I don't feel like I can show it or act on it (Arlene, MHW09, L41).

The next day Arlene expresses how much she has enjoyed the performance saying she 'found it very powerful'. She also expresses her awareness of how difficult she has found it to have her personal-self drawn into an event she had expected to attend from her public-personae. 'It was quite a shock … other service-providers there found it similarly [shocking], the way it touched our own lives … was unexpected' (Arlene, MHW09, L28). This dilemma is not unusual in the helping professions where boundaries are highly valued, and there is a duty of care. The Playback Theatre ritual does not contract to observe these boundaries. Rather it approaches all audience members with equal interest and with equal commitment to including them. This does not necessarily lead to an easy relaxing of the boundaries for people present in their professional roles alongside their customers, clients or subordinates. A similar distancing due to roles has been observed at the Disability Action Week performance (Brett, DAW07, L41).

**6.2.6 Nothing to tell**

So far in this chapter I have reported various examples of audience members recalling memories, experiences and stories that they could share if the conditions conspired. However, there are audience members who claim that they could not 'think of anything' during performances. This could be explained by what Spolin (1999) argues about participation in improvised performance: that it does not emerge from a place of reason, but rather is an intuitive act, in the moment. Thus, it is not likely that 'thinking of something' to tell will necessarily engage the participant in the ritual frame. Bea (Rec01, L193) describes her experience of not summoning a story as not being 'triggered'. Other informants indicated that the desire to tell could not be manufactured. For example, participants report 'trying to think of something' and 'racking their brains' for something to tell (Asha, Mar03, L324) without result.

**6.2.7 The Teller's Performance**

As was illustrated earlier in Hillary's story, some audience members participate in the Playback Theatre ritual by telling a story from the stage. The conductor collaborates with this teller.

Together they work to produce the telling performance. After they have crafted the telling of the story, the teller remains alongside the conductor on stage and watches as the actors and musician play the story back. Carly has experienced this during the Disability Action week performance. Onstage, her wheelchair has been pulled up alongside me. She is playful and confident. I have observed that she appears comfortable with the attention she is getting from the audience and from me. She recounts a recent experience about a Wheelchair Basketball event for Disability Action Week. In her story, elite wheelchair basketballers compete with elite basketballers who are unused to using wheelchairs. The story ends with Carly stating she feels delighted with the way in which the audience and participants of the game co-operated to make the basketball game a success. It was hilarious and a good time (for the full story see Appendix 8). Similarly, the playing back has been a co-operative success. Carly speaks with me about her experience of watching her story:

I loved the touch of humour. Humour is very important to me. It's such an important part of life, and they were able to do that, even though it was something sensitive.

I thought the girls did a fantastic job with it. It's not easy. I was thinking to myself, 'Sorry about this.' I think it must be good for you guys to do things that are different, that challenge you … It was interesting watching the actors, [laughing] they didn’t know what to do. They were put on the spot, then getting more comfortable … Then what that does in turn though is make the audience more open about sharing. They watch that and see, 'oh maybe it's a bit vulnerable, but so what.' I applauded their willingness to give it a go. It was such a positive thing. I probably didn’t even initially think about how hard it would be for them to act it … It was just a great story, (then) I thought, 'oh you poor bastards' [laughing].

They did a great job (Carly, DAW06, L277).

This excerpt highlights Carly's appreciation for humour. Humour has been identified regularly by audience members as an engaging aspect of the performance. While audience members and tellers acknowledge catharsis as a significant response, transcripts (see for example Pride05, L31, Jul05, L71) and observation data (OD0b, L294) reveal that having both laughter and tears is most favoured. Rebecca makes the following comment in a reflective dialogue: It feels as though the community is much stronger after one or the other has happened, and there seems to be great permission to look around, and connect with people (OD0b, L456).

After the Mental Health Week show, audience members express relief and gratitude at having the opportunity to express 'deep seated sadness' (MHW02, L37). A few informants couple this gratitude with words like feeling 'wrecked', 'ragged', and 'drained'. The text transcript reveals that there was little humour in the Mental Health Week show. However, in other performances dealing with potentially serious subject matter, like Reconciliation, Refugee Week, and the Disability Action Week performance from which Carly's experience is drawn, moments of laughter and moments of tears, have been acknowledged and appreciated equally.

One audience member states, 'There was a sense of humour to it, which I hadn't see before and I liked that. I tend to lose my sense of humour' (Jude, Rec04, L36). Yet, laughter for laughter's sake has been seen to undermine the integrity of the performance (Pride07, L348).

Carly's comments suggest that she has engaged in reflective distancing in order to make sense of or analyse what was going on as she told her story. Informant interviews and observation notes indicate that telling a story and watching the enactment of that story can be two quite different experiences. One example of this is Darcy, whose experience of telling has been exhilarating. She attended the July Public Performance with three of her girlfriends where she told a story from long ago about traveling in Europe. I have noticed that she seemed to enjoy sharing about this fond time. She describes her experience of watching her story enacted as humbling. She reports:

The kind of honesty that it invites is interesting. When I told my story, to actually have to admit to feeling the fear in seeing the black men was a thing where I felt ashamed, if I think about it. But that was there, that was me, that was what I was like. So that comes up in the story. I wouldn’t feel like that now, but I did then.

Looking at that and experiencing the kind of shame that comes from admitting that. I thought, 'I wonder if they all think I’m a racist' (Darcy, Jul05, L151).

This example shows Darcy's reflection on her younger self. In sharing this story, she undertakes what Frank (1995) calls "an ethics of recollection". This is when "one who recollects and shares memories of past action, [displays their] past to others," and takes responsibility for their actions (p.132).

Coming to the stage to tell a story within the ritual frame of Playback Theatre does not always result in the audience member having control over the story that they have told. In Chapter 2 I have written about the storytelling performance being a duet with the conductor and storyteller working together to produce the storytelling performance. During this duet, the conductor assists the teller and the resulting story can hold a surprise for the storyteller. This relationship demands attentive listening by the conductor while simultaneously attending the production values of the performance and the large group connection. There is every possibility that the conductor could veer the story off into a direction that is more comfortable for them, or intervene in a way that leads the teller to forget what they wanted to tell. This relationship is an improvised performance, so it adds to the overall theatre of the event if it is fresh and alive, however, not to the extent that the conductor's rather than the teller's needs are central. One teller recounts the experience of forgetting her story as she walked to the stage. Phoebe remarks, 'When I got up there and sat next to you, I went completely blank' (Rec06, L181). Another speaks about being unable to determine whether her story has made sense. She says, 'I thought hopefully everyone will see (in the enactment) what I'm rambling on about, and they obviously did because the (actors) knew exactly what I was feeling' (Pride02, L702).

In this section I have reported on the ways in which audience members participate in the Playback Theatre ritual event. I have compiled a number of examples to illustrate the way in which people might enter the liminal zone (evoked by the ritual framework of Playback Theatre) and share their story. I have presented details about why people chose not to tell and why they might resist telling. This has informed the discussion on what might get in the way of people sharing their stories during the Playback Theatre performance. Next I suggest that while there are a number of barriers to participation and there are also factors that enable participation.

**6.2.8 Enabling Participation: Audience-audience interaction**

Co-observers have confirmed my observations that people's ease at participating increases during times of audience-audience interaction. These are the times during the performance when, as conductor, I direct people to one-on-one or small group sharing of stories they have remembered, or responses they have had to the stories they have seen and heard. The value of these interactions is illustrated in the following comment:

It was really nice to meet other people. It’s quite rare to chat to the person sitting next to you, for example and I probably wouldn’t have done except that you’re directed to do so by the people on stage (Sebastian, Jul05, L106).

This participatory device creates a kind of in-between space at the Playback Theatre performance enabling audience members to move toward participating and enjoy some success in participation. Good (1986) suggests that this notion of introducing strangers could build interpersonal and group connections. These in-between spaces facilitate the experience of flow for some audience members who would otherwise have been preoccupied with negotiating the ambivalent private-public threshold. Perhaps the relaxed or less performative nature of this way of participating means that audience members feel a greater ease with the idea of telling a story and are therefore enabled to experience flow60. One audience member comments, 'It’s really good how Rea got us to talk amongst ourselves. It lightened everything so much. I actually felt a lot more comfortable to tell my story' (Gigi, Pride07, L179). This aligns with Csikszentmihalyi (1992) notion that participants will feel more inclined to join in if they have a sense that they will succeed. Johnstone (1981) also speaks of the likelihood of participation increasing if people can make sense of the rules or social requirements. This

60 Additional opportunities for group participation occurred when I, in my role as conductor, invited audience members to take on dramatic roles. This occurred in the Reconciliation performance where the audience was invited to play the role of Anthony's extended family in a story about learning a family secret. It also occurred in the Disability Action Week performance where audience members were asked to play the role of the crowd watching the basketball game. In both instances audience members remained in their seats and acted as group, making sounds of disapproval or sounds of a cheering crowd respectively.

could build confidence in audience members and possibly reduce anxiety about the more challenging task of sharing in the larger group.

Sharing stories in small groups acts as a kind of rehearsal for participants who are feeling anxious about the degree to which they might reveal themselves. Karp (1994) suggests that lowering anxiety liberates spontaneity and enables a greater degree of play and risk taking.

Group and individual interviews reveal that the interaction between audience members is often a time when they 'practiced' telling their story (Rec01, L216). This occurred at the March Public performance where Liam has broached the idea of telling his story with his friends (March03, L114). For some audience members the brief airing of their story has boosted their confidence in it and enabled them to see the relevance of telling it for themselves and the audience. Anthony claimed to have come to the Reconciliation show without a story. He says: I really thought I came here not having stories about reconciliation, and there was

[a woman] sitting next to me and we started chatting. All of a sudden [she] said something that actually brought a tear to [her] eye, it might have been something that happened up on stage and it brought a tear to [her] eye. I turned around and I

got that, and then all of a sudden there was some sort of a connection to [her], and then when we started chatting my story came out. It just clicked there, I didn't have a story but I did (Anthony, Rec03, L136).

Anthony's experience shows how telling stories is a way of remembering (Schank in Frank, 1995). His initial experience of being unable to recall a story could be attributed to the ritual context creating conditions for people to have flow experiences, rather than cogent-driven experiences. Turner (1982) suggests that trying to think can inhibit flow. Perhaps the opportunity to speak to someone in the audience has acted like a break in flow for Anthony and he has then been able to recall an experience that he felt he wanted to share. Alternatively, the activity may have provided sufficient challenge for Anthony enabling flow and the subsequent recollection of his story.

While the opportunity to participate in what could be considered a semi-public way has been useful to many this still proved too challenging for some. Alice admits that she 'felt embarrassed' by the suggestion to chat to the person nearby. She says, 'It made me feel more exposed - I wanted to pull myself together' (MHW03, L62). Sebastian reveals that his response has been one of uncertainty about those audience members sitting nearby. He states, 'I felt inhibited talking to those around me. That was a bit to do with fear of difference, people of different races, and there was a man with a disability' (MDA11, L25). Conversely,

observational data suggest that this interactive time could lead to a breach in the ritual, whereby, audience members choose to continue speaking to those nearby, ignoring the invitation of the conductor to return their focus to the stage action (OD0a, L616). To meditate this the conductor must assert their authority as master-of-ceremonies. This breach in the ritual could arise when using the audience-audience interaction technique. At the July Public Performance, three of the tellers belonged to the same friendship group and encouraged each other to volunteer. At other times, friends and acquaintances have used this less formal time for non-specific catch-up discussions, although at times this has also led to an individual realising they had a story to tell (DAW, L380).

**6.3** **Summary**

For some audience members the removal of the conventional boundary between stage and auditorium and the enticement to participate is threatening and confusing. The interactive style of Playback Theatre raises questions about what is expected of the audience. Unlike, the orientation of a Brechtian audience toward distanced judgement, the ritual performance event intends the audience "to be swept up into the performance" (Schechner, 1985, p.10), and to be active participants. Indeed, the findings indicate that participation in the Playback Theatre performance could occur at any point along this distanced-to-swept up continuum, with the ritual framing of the form making it hard for audiences to resist engagement. This chapter has discussed the tension that arises for audience members due to the interactive nature of Playback Theatre. It has established that audience members’ capacity to engage is influenced by their expectations and their initial impressions of the event, the venue, the Company, and others that are present. In order to transform their initial expectations and overcome any resistance to participation audience members undergo moments of reflective distance. This enables them to move toward flow and a greater experience of the liminal spaces evoked in the Playback Theatre ritual.

The move in and out of the liminal or flow experience in the Playback Theatre performance in order to reflect and re-negotiate their level of engagement can be prompted by a number of tension-inducing elements for audience members. Perhaps they have been involved in the ongoing assessment and integration of things like the tension between the fictive and the real; the tension between what they heard in the story and what they saw in the enactment; the tension between their own story, and the story of the other/s; and the tension between whether to participate, and when, or whether to watch. These tensions can meld synergistically with the liminal effect of the ritual frame and produce a performance experience that is complex, and induce in the participant a heightened sense of the collective risk-taking involved, and a desire to reflect on the experience. In this chapter I have discussed the various complexities that audience members experience when they engage as a participant and suggest why some people will experience significant barriers to participation. There are pointers to a number of conditions that need to be established in order to maximise the opportunities to participate for all people.

The way in which audience members are enabled to participate in and influence the course of the show is stimulating and rewarding. The performance progresses through a dynamic rhythm that shifts and builds throughout the performance: from the invitation to participate, to listening to the storyteller, transferring attention to the actors, then back to conductor, the next teller, and the next enactment. My written reflections reveal this shifting focus. For example:

People don't see the transitions. They are in them. If we take our time, they wait for us. It is part of the ritual process. It's the picture that they're waiting for. We're up there to make pictures that capture the story. … There's quite a lot required of them as the energy flow gets handed around from the conductor, to the teller, to the performers. It's a true collaboration (Rea, OD05, L59 and OD01, L1731).

Once the storytelling performance commences, audience members move their attention away from their response to the invitation to participate and become fixed on the storyteller. This involves a shift to a different role at the commencement of the enactment, where audience members listen and want to connect in some way. In their role as spectator audience members watch the actors' efforts, keep an eye on the teller and others in the audience, and sit back and enjoy the 'play'. This is explored in the following chapter.
