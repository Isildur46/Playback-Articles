# CHAPTER FOUR: Methodology

The show is over. There is so much to document - my experiences and perceptions. The text. Other things I have observed. Meanwhile, the ritual is incomplete. I go off with the actors for an exhilarated (or not) debrief. Then back into the crowd. I see people and wave. Meet people and listen to people. There is a buzz. It feels as if people are all talking at once. Someone tells me a story. I am listening. I am juggling my competing agendas. I resist asking too much wanting them to lead me in the conversation. It is their spontaneous reflections that I am interested in. Upstairs, a group has gathered. Their conversation will be captured on audiotape. I will not have to strain to remember. Others stand around sharing stories and critiquing the form, the theatre, and the event. I let go of what I think I should ask and what I think I should have documented already. I once again surrender to the liminal, brimming with my unwritten reflections and observations. The ritual maintaining its influence.

It is some time later crammed with multiple conversations - I sit alone. The show reverberates in me with such energies that I cannot write. How to express all of this. The pen and page appear so limited, so reducing of the experiences, the feelings. I jot names or descriptions or some other identifying note about who I want to interview. Eventually, I make abbreviated notes that will guide me toward more comprehensive memos. I document my perspective on the themes of the performance. The analysis is underway (Reflective journal, July 2002).

This excerpt from my reflective journal is an example of the visceral and embodied nature of my reflective practice. My experiences of these somewhat intense interactions between the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual engagement during Playback Theatre performance work have been instrumental in precipitating this research project. The study has provided a place to examine my practice of Playback Theatre in a bid to better understand and better articulate its purposes and potentiality. In this chapter, I report on the methodology that I

have implemented to explore the application of Playback Theatre in the community contexts in which I practice.

When planning and conducting research, Denzin and Lincoln (2000b) state that the researcher must "confront two issues: research design and choice of strategy of inquiry" (p.367). Crotty (1998) asserts that the choices made at this stage must be congruent with the "purposes" of the research and take into consideration four elements: methods, methodology, theoretical perspective, and epistemology (p.2). The requirements of researching performance are considered in the first section. The rationale for and application of the multi-method approach I implement in this inquiry are documented. I discuss my choice to combine the ethnographic activities of informant interviews and observation with researcher reflexivity derived from my purposeful practice reflections as an insider-researcher. I introduce and describe the use of reflective partners to ensure transparency, rigour and trustworthiness through techniques of co-observation and co-analysis. I describe how the inquiry was physically situated in specific community contexts defined by the performance program of the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company. I recount the iterative data collection, analysis and reporting stages of the research process and describe how this process has entailed conversations, transcription and journaling. The shape of the thesis has emerged by looking for patterns, for disconfirming data, or what Atkinson, Coffey & Delamont (2003) call "divergences" (p.155), contradictions, absent voices, and singularities. Finally I discuss verifiability and trustworthiness with respect to this approach.

**4.1** **Researching Playback Theatre**

Researching performance is a complex proposition. Roberta Mock (2000) articulates this complexity suggesting that it is in part due to the interaction between theory and practice in an emergent field that is seeking ways to define itself. Further, she acknowledges that documenting

The ephemeral 'presentness' of performance, its 'liveness', can make any attempts at retrospective analysis relying on memory seem somewhat obsolete and redundant, since even watching a mediated re-production on, for example, video is incomplete, or at the very least 'different', and one must (re)construct the atmosphere and feeling evoked in the course of a performance. In many ways the 'moment' has passed and another had begun (p.2).

Here, Mock (2000) suggests that data about audience experiences of the live performance are generated after the event and therefore exist as a retrospective. Elsewhere in performance theory, a retrospective data collection such as this would be conceived as another

'performance' in which I, as researcher, become audience (see Carlson, 1996). In many ways I *have been* audience to informants while simultaneously performing the research role and creating the research domain through solo and ensemble improvisation. Given this, selecting the methods for this study has presented me with an interesting conundrum. This is particularly due to what seems to me to be similarities between the requirements of qualitative *inquiry* and the way in which the Playback Theatre method is *inquiring*. For example, Hosking & Penny (1998) claim that Playback Theatre is

A methodology for the exploration of an issue or concern rather than message driven theatre … [that facilitates a move toward the] understanding and expression of what is occurring and the underlying social values. … [It] may be used to stimulate change, … to explore questions … (p.10-11).

I have experienced additional layers of complexity coming to terms with the methodology and methods of inquiry in the study due to the similarities or overlap of what has been required of me as researcher and what I have long experienced in my own reflective practice. It has been essential for me to come to terms with the differences and similarities of these two roles for the purpose of the study. A primary similarity has concerned the improvised nature of qualitative inquiry: a process that requires a well articulated framework so that as researcher I am enabled to respond to the data as it emerges, engage creatively with informants and make intuitive decisions in-the-moment. Meanwhile, the primary difference has been the containment of the reflexive process through purposeful reflection informed by the emerging research questions and the focus of the study. There have also been similarities and differences in the way in which stories feature. This is discussed further later in the chapter. Both because of and in spite of these similarities and differences I have elected to implement the "multi-method" approach Denzin and Lincoln (2000a) claim is required in such studies (p.5).

The research design is derived in response to the stated purpose of the research. In the previous chapter I stated that the overarching question guiding the study is:

- What are audience members' experiences of the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance?

The sub-questions this study seeks to answer are:

- In what ways do the audience members engage and respond during and after the one-off community-based event?
- In what ways does the Playback Theatre form induce these experiences?
- In what ways is Playback Theatre an experience of community for audience members within the specific context?

As Maxwell (1996) predicts, the study has required me to undertake a "significant part of the research before it [is] clear what specific research question" I can answer (p.47). In the spirit of exploration, I have been influenced by the Marshall and Rossman (1995) recommendation that an ethnographic approach is appropriate in exploratory studies seeking to understand what is happening. The study is what Denzin and Lincoln (2000a) and previously, Lather (1991) term interpretive inquiry. Lather (1991) recommends the interpretive research paradigm when the researcher wants to *understand* a social world. The research has therefore been premised on relationships with informants in their social world. As an interpretive inquiry, informants' experiences have been considered in light of the context within which they have occurred.

Crotty (1998) suggests that stating the research paradigm makes explicit my assumptions and highlights the theoretical perspective implicit in them. He proposes that assumptions implicit in interpretive inquiry are: that there are multiple realities in the social world being studied, i.e.,

Playback Theatre; that any "understanding" I develop is co-created dialogically with participants and the social environment; and that "naturalistic" methodological procedures are used. Next, I elaborate on these methodological procedures.

**4.2** **A Multi-method Approach**

As stated above, the focus of the research has been audience members' experiences of Playback Theatre. Writing about their vision for the future of qualitative research, Lincoln & Denzin (2000) state that they are certain of some things with regard to qualitative inquiry.

They concede that "the qualitative researcher is not an objective, authoritative, politically neutral observer" who stands outside of the text (p.1049, see also Atkinson, Coffey & Delamont, 2003). Rather, the qualitative researcher is both historically positioned and locally situated: an "all too human observer of the human condition" in a world where meaning is plural and political. "Qualitative inquiry is properly conceptualized as a civic, participatory, collaborative project. This joins the researcher and researched in an ongoing moral dialogue" (Lincoln & Denzin, 2000, p.1049). An ethnographic approach provides adequate scope to embrace this spirit and address the transient nature of the performance environment alive with spontaneous activity.

Crotty (1998) recommends an ethnographic approach when seeking meanings and perceptions from the point of view of informants. The ethnographic approach also facilitates my insider stance with researcher/practitioner reflexivity facilitated through the observer role. My insider positioning in the social environment has been embedded and has inhibited my capacity to appreciate how I have accomplished the requirements of rigour and trustworthiness in the research process. Rather than this being problematic it has been instrumental in my establishing the creative process through which my limitations and biases have been interrogated as the research progressed. This has involved co-observational and co-analysis activities with reflective partners. This arrangement has provided some counterpoint to the highly subjective nature of my gaze, and has acted to enhance the trustworthiness of the findings. The way in which the reflective partners have contributed is discussed later in the chapter. The combining of reflexivity and the methods of ethnography has resulted in a research design that Lincoln and Guba (2000) call a multi-method approach. Denzin & Lincoln (1994) draw together a number of voices in acclaiming the value of multiple methods for maximising the rigor of ethnographic projects such as mine. They promote the triangulation arising from the use of multiple methods as a sound alternative to validation. They state that the multiple perspectives generated in a multi-method study act to add "rigor, breadth and depth to any investigation" (in Fine, Weis, Weseen & Wong, 2000, p.119).

A naturalistic form of qualitative inquiry, ethnography is derivative of both anthropology & sociology (Agar, 1980, 1986, Brewer, 2000, van Maanen, 1988). In the past four decades, it has established its currency in non-exotic locations, or locations in which the researcher is not a stranger (Ely, 1991) and is the method of choice in performance contexts (Donelan, 2002). In response to what Lincoln and Denzin (2000) term crises of legitimation, representation and vocality, contemporary ethnography has become new (Atkinson, Coffey & Delamont, 2003), critical (Brewer, 2000) and conscious (Angrosino & Mays de Pérez, 2000). This revamp coincides with ethnography's response to criticisms of its inherent colonising potential and move toward what Donelan (2002) calls "participatory anthropology" (p.37), a position that implicates the researcher particularly in observing and writing roles where their authority may previously have gone unchecked (Angrosino & Mays de Pérez, 2000). The contemporary ethnographic methods of participant observation, informant (participant) interviews and reflexivity (in the form of research journal and reflective partners) have been used in this study.

Employing an ethnographic approach has enabled me to privilege the voices of the audience members and include my subjective voice. Writing four decades ago, Schutz (1964) argues that social research must safeguard the subjective point of view, otherwise the reported social reality could be "a fictional non-existing world constructed by the scientific observer" (in Holstein & Gubrium, 1998, p.138). The contributions of feminist researchers (Olesen, 2000, Reinharz, 1992, Stacey, 1988) and anti-oppressive research proponents (see for example, Angrosino & Mays de Pérez, 2000) has seen the valued inclusion of the subjective voices of both informant and researcher. The interaction of these stances is intrinsic to a qualitative inquiry such as the one employed in this study. The study design is responsive to the 'alive in the moment' then gone, changed, or transformed nature of the performance. Agar (1986) suggests that ethnographic methods can assist the researcher to focus on the moment, on "what just occurred" not what comes next (p.16). Similarly, an ethnographic approach supports the emergent nature of the process, the spirit of which is expressed by the eloquent, albeit somewhat dramatic metaphor:

As the carver holds the unworked ivory lightly in his (sic) hand, turning it this way and that, he whispers, "Who are you? Who hides there?" … He (sic) rarely sets out, at least consciously, to carve, say, a seal, but picks up the ivory, examines it to find form and, if that is not immediately apparent, carves aimlessly until he sees it,

humming or chanting as he works. Then …[it] emerges (Carpenter in Wolcott,

1995, p.27).

While far from aimless in my whittling, or carving, as the case may be, the metaphor expresses the essential exploratory nature of the research process. Next, I describe the methods used for data collection.

**4.2.1 Researcher Reflexivity** 🖉 **Reflective Practice**

Researching as a *real* participant observer in my own social (practice) world implies an intention to a critically reflexive stance. Olesen (2000) argues that research in which the distance between the researcher and research is dissolved demands "strongly reflexive" descriptions about the researcher's role in the research (p.229). One could assume that in taking on the researcher role I am inclined to critique the social environment and myself. Not withstanding, ethnography demands such a critical position (Angrosino & Mays de Pérez,

2000). Through reflexivity the researcher assumes a stance of self-consciousness. This demands that I reflect on my influence on the data that I collect and interrogate it for the assumptions that inform my interpretations (Lather, 1991). Schwandt (2000) reminds the reader that meaning is negotiated in the act of interpretation. Maxwell (1996) suggests that experiential knowledge and critical subjectivity expressed while doing practice represent a valid creation and use of theory. However, Bundy (2001) cautions that knowledge claims arising from reflective practice must be "considered tentative and situated" (p.22). While the study has not been "my practice" per se, data have been generated from my reflective practice activities - as I have researched I have continued to perform. The juxtaposition of my researcher/practitioner roles has continued throughout the research. I have experienced a high degree of congruency between my natural style and practice values, and the research method I have been enacting. I have felt comfortable with the way the research role has pushed me onto the margins of my work, of the Company, in the academy. I have been simultaneously observer and integral participant.

**4.2.2 Observation**

Observations have been undertaken from an engaged-participant perspective rather than the once preferred neutral, detached perspective (Angrosino & Mays de Pérez, 2000). Throughout the research I have utilised co-observers in a bid to maximise the data I have sourced in the transient episodic social environments of the Playback Theatre performance. I have employed three co-observers - Dawn, Craig and Rebecca - each with a different relationship to Playback Theatre. Dawn has had no affiliation with performance-based environments other than through her association with me. As my partner, she has been involved in Playback Theatre for as long as I have been involved. Her previous audience experience has been at Brisbane Playback Theatre Company's public performances. She has also fulfilled the front-of-house function at the annual Pride performance. She maintains a healthy skepticism toward the form and has never told a story during a Playback Theatre performance20. While she is supportive of my involvement, she is often critical about elements of performances or dispassionate about what she experiences. Craig is an associate who teaches secondary drama at a private girl's school in inner-Brisbane. Craig's Playback Theatre exposure has been limited to an encounter approximately ten years ago. His position about Playback Theatre includes that it might have something to offer but he has concerns about teller safety and agency, the influence of the conductor on the outcome of the performance, and the scope of the form to generate aesthetically pleasing theatre. Rebecca was a novice in the Brisbane Playback Theatre

Company at the time of the research. Relatively new to the form, she has offered the enthusiasm of a disciple coupled with a desire to deconstruct and interrogate Playback Theatre as a learner21.

My observational activity has been enacted from my participant roles as conductor and actor, while the co-observers have participated as audience members22. In addition to observing others in the social environment, Donelan (2002) posits that participant-observer activity demands observation of the self as participant. In effect observational activity has involved noting my own experiences of the performance: what I have observed through my eyes, ears, nose, and skin, what my thoughts have been, and what I have felt in my body. Donelan (2002) suggests that such ethnographic activity is "deeply linked with performance in its awareness of itself as an embodied practice" (p.38). The employment of co-observers has contributed to the

20 For many years, she found Playback Theatre tedious or overly indulgent. She stated, 'I used to think, what rubbish is this, come on let’s go home' (Dawn, OD01, L1423). On the eve of the research, she attended a performance in which the subject matter was so closely aligned to her personal life she felt drawn to tell a story for the first time in ten years of Playback Theatre. She remarked, 'It was at a point when I hadn't told any stories. I thought, I might [interfere] with it (the research), so I shut my mouth. … [The conductor] kept looking at me, and I thought, 'No. I can't' (OD02, L594).

21 Rebecca's motivation to deconstruct is based on her desire to understand Playback Theatre better and perform it better. I found her critical approach to be uncommon in my experience of people new to Playback Theatre.

22 Rebecca was also role of front-of-house at the performances she attended.

transparency of researcher motive and has added the element of safeguarding participants that Fine, Weis, Weseen, and Wong (2000) report is required of research striving to be anti-oppressive. A description of how the co-observer data has been used occurs later in the chapter.

**4.2.3 Informant Interviews**

Literature reports that informant interviews can take multiple forms from "casual conversations"(Wolcott, 1995, p.169, Fetterman, 1998) to facilitated group discussions23 immediately after the performance (Sauter, 2002). Stewart and Shamdasani (1990) recommend a group-style interview as a way to maximise participant reflectivity. They suggest that the group interview is an effective way of gaining multiple perspectives and facilitates more diversity and depth due to the interaction between informants. Fetterman (1998) suggests that interviews can be structured, semi-structured or informal. Glover (2003) promotes a less formal approach as a way of giving greater control of the direction of the interview to the participant. Coffey and Atkinson (1996) assert that approaching interviews as conversations could generate rich data. The informal conversation exchange between the researcher and participant invites the informant to recount stories. Drawing on Mishler, Coffey and Atkinson recommend that interview responses can be considered in light of the stories they embody. This has provided a useful framework for conducting group and individual interviews during the research. In some ways, audience members have been like participant observers attempting to articulate the story of what happened, and what they have experienced. This has best been articulated in a conversational fashion where participants have told stories as a way of reasoning or making sense and as a way of representation (Richardson, 1990). In some respects the "live" nature of the event has continued after each performance, through this

23 My thanks to Willmar Sauter (2002, pers. comm.) for this interview structure. While I was familiar with focus group interviews (Stewart & Shamdasani, 1990), an encounter with Willmar assisted me in my research design. My concern that interviews at performances would be overly intrusive was eased when he explained his prior use of after-show conversation groups.

recounting of experiences and perceptions by informants. My response has been to listen from my experience of the performance without trying to interpret or direct. I now discuss the reflexive activities I have implemented in the study to ensure transparency and trustworthiness in light of the inter-subjectivity discussed above.

**4.2.4 Reflective Journal**

Throughout the research, my journal has been a constant companion. In it I have made direct observations and stream-of-consciousness reflective notes. These notes express my feelings and preliminary thinking about what I have observed and experienced. They contain debriefing statements and details of my engagement as a performer and researcher. The journal houses a "hotch-potch" (Ely, Vinz, Downing & Anzul, 1997) of voices and genres that have emerged from different stages during the research journey. My Playback Theatre practice has always been deeply affecting. My experiences of speaking or writing about the resonances from my Playback Theatre practice have often been fraught with inadequate words, or inaccessible unexpressed ideas and feelings that felt lodged in my body, deep in my muscle. This is not uncommon with embodied practice. Anthropologist, Margaret Somerville (1999) writes of her experience:

Journal writing was reluctant and spasmodic because I had to remember the images during the massage, and these images were often not articulated into words.

It meant bringing myself out of a deep trance-like consciousness to cross over the bridge between semiotic and symbolic, to give the images words, and then to remember them. I decided it might be possible to reflect on the experience of my body in other places (p.14).

This phenomenon has also permeated my research experience. My reflective journal eventually contained conceptual memos mapping my thinking about themes, possible informants, questions for reflective partners and what I have identified as gaps in the data. In many ways, the journal has been a documentation of my practice reflection continually re-framed in light of the emerging research questions. In other ways, my journal has documented my emotional journey and what I have been learning from my emotions. Atkinson, Coffey and Delamont

(2003) draw on Gearing to recommend an approach to ethnography that embraces "what we learn from our emotions … [and where] sensation, emotion and intellect operate simultaneously to structure and interpret our experiences of the [social] world" (p.57).

**4.2.5 Researcher Bias**

Researcher reflexivity demands that I reveal the assumptions and biases that have arisen from my embedded position as an insider. Feminist researchers suggest that there are "multiple positions, selves, and identities at play in the research process" (Oleson, 2000, p.227). During the research I have undertaken the roles of researcher, practitioner, performer, activist, teacher, director, and producer within the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company. While the researcher and practitioner roles have been dominant in terms of the reflexive dimension of data collection, excellence in performance (my estimation of what's possible with the Playback Theatre method) has been a key value driving my research journey. I am individually committed to understanding better what worked and what did not work from the point of view of the audience. This has included a particular interest in the stylistic and bold theatricalising of personal story, the acknowledgement of the context-specific influences on the work, and the intuitive and daring conducting of audiences and individuals. Adjacent to the values of excellence in performance are personal values of social justice and poetic expression and the belief in a "yes and" approach to life. These personal and professional perspectives influence the way in which I have enacted the research.

One idea I had about Playback Theatre at the start of the research journey aligns to Muckley's position (1996). She writes that the Playback Theatre performance contains scope "to reveal truth[s] and facilitate understanding between people" (Muckley, 1996, p.2). Bett, Pearson and Russell (1999) assert that in its simplest form, a Playback Theatre performance is a place where "people tell their story, and in their telling, the story of the audience or community unfolds" (p.1). In addition, Playback Theatre should provide a place where:

- risk is valued over caution;
- marginal voices are actively sought;
- interaction is alive and dialogic;
- social and political structures are illuminated; and
- people have fun.

Gergen and Gergen (2000) assert that this act of explicating my biases and assumptions is a fundamental aspect of reflexive research. I also wish to acknowledge the parallel process of reflective practice that has juxtaposed the researcher role. My reflexive activity has been iterative and dialectic and at times has converged with my practice reflection. Given the influence of my biases on my researcher role, it has been necessary to extend my reflexive practice purview for the course of this study. This has resulted in the interrogation of my presence, my data and the way in which I have interpreted the data. This critical approach to reflecting on my research self, my research relationships and my analysis has made up a large part of my personal journal and transcription notes. Thus, with the ethnographic methods enabling me to frame the inquiry in a way that incorporates multiple perspectives, and with my participatory function giving me legitimacy and affording me extensive access, the reflexive process has provided additional data for verification and trustworthiness. Further, the combination of these methods has elevated my ethnographic position to a more humanistic realm where people's interpretive practices are privileged in the constitution of social reality (Brewer, 2000).

**4.3** **The Place of Reflective Practice**

As suggested earlier, my reflective practice has been a source of data in the study. This has emerged from my intensive "personal involvement" in the research (Agar, 1986 p.12). It has been an exciting time where, as practitioner and researcher, I have been at the centre of the process, with all the likely confusion and imperfect outcomes that holds. In a countenance to the traditional tendency "to view the self of the social science observer as a potential contaminant, something to be separated out, neutralised, minimised, standardised, and controlled," (Fine et al. p.108), my stance has been to deliberately draw on myself as central to the story. This centrality has positioned me as an "instrument" in the study (Ely, 1991, p.33) and has been congruent with roles in my Playback Theatre practice. By maintaining my roles as an active Playback Theatre performer during the research, I have been also in the parallel role of "citizen scholar", so eloquently named by Saxton (in Vidich & Lyman, 2000, p.59).

As a practitioner, I have been constantly keeping an eye out for theory and as a scholar, I have been constantly contextualising my thinking about what I was observing in my practice experience. Soule (1998) claims that theatre and practice in theatre-making is "bonded in organic interaction, so much so that if, at some point in the process we try to disassemble the activity into two ostensibly individual parts, both theory and practice stops growing" (p.39).

Hoogland's (2003) insights about the interaction of practice and scholarship provide clarification for me as I embark on the data collection. She states:

Although I have been a practicing artist for longer than I have been an academic … I did not understand how my practice was inextricably fused to my scholarship, and how my poetic and dramatic writing informs my research and teaching (p.211).

I too have experienced this inextricable fusion. So, in many ways, this study has been constitutive of my reflective practice. Schön (1983) and Hess (1995) assert that practitioners often play critical roles in advancing knowledge and understanding. Hess states that we are in a position to:

Observe, evaluate and report the effects of [our] practice; identify relevant practice knowledge; and pose questions emerging from [our] practice (Hess, 1995, p.56).

Fook (1996) proposes that when practitioners reflect two things happen: 1) they learn from their experience; and 2) they unearth "all sorts of theoretical assumptions they were not aware of" (p.2). She states that a reflexive approach builds knowledge (Fook, 1996, Fonow & Cook,

1991). Mattingly (1998) promotes it as a way of making sense of the practice context. The reflexive process has demanded that I interrogate my practice but perhaps more accurately, it has demanded that I reconsider my practice behaviour, values, and assumptions (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000). It is in these ways that the reflective practice stance has much in common with a critical ethnographic approach where, as Donelan (2002) suggests, performer (researcher) experience is regarded as a way of knowing and a mode of understanding as well as a method of critical inquiry (p.38). Research/practice reflections have contributed to the body of data as observation notes, journal notes and interpretation of audience experiences.

Throughout the research, I have encountered some of the ethical quandaries predicted in contemporary critiques about practice-based research (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000). I have made an impression. At times I have made an impact and have wanted to change things in the Company's work ethic and artistic expression. I have been drawn to contemplate the various social or institutional changes I desire both in the Company and in the broader Playback Theatre movement. These are the behaviours Angrosino and Mays de Pérez (2000) warn about, as possibly intrusive in research (also see Atweh, Kemmis & Weeks, 1998). The study of my practice has influenced some members in the Company and has led to my advocating for some changes. This has caused some unrest, yet the disturbance certainly stimulated creativity in our performances. The intensity of the reflective requirements of the research has led to other consequences as a performer and rehearsal director. While strategies like those Fine, Weis, Weseen and Wong (2000) recommend have helped me maximise the transparency of the process and assisted me to maintain a research focus, I have not always known what is required to balance the impact of the research on my practice. In some ways, the researcher/practitioner interaction has been an ethical dilemma for me as I have undertaken the research.

**4.4** **Researcher Subjectivity and Trustworthiness**

Fetterman (1998) writes that insider researchers require a third point of intersection or "multiple voicing" (Gergen & Gergen, 2000, p.1028) beyond that of the researcher and the informants to ensure trustworthiness in empirical research processes (Olesen, 2000). In the past decade researcher subjectivity has been established as an intrinsic dimension to qualitative research where notions of validity and veracity have been replaced by notions of trustworthiness and verifiability (Smith, 2002). This shift emerges from the postmodern rejection of absolute truth and certainty in favour of multiple perspectives and 'goodness' (Smith, 2002). Schwandt (in Smith, 2002) state that the goal of qualitative inquiry "is not to produce knowledge of the social world as an entity but to engage in knowledge making as a human activity". This insinuates that researchers approach human inquiry with "a sense of moral purpose and responsibility" (Schwandt in Smith, 2000, p.140). Researcher reflexivity is promoted as a valid avenue to trustworthiness and transparency (see Atkinson, Coffey, & Delamont, 2003, Lincoln & Denzin, 2000, Smith, 2000).

The insider stance and the integration of reflective practice have introduced a significant challenge for me as researcher. In Atkinson, Coffey and Delamont's (2003) terms I have had to find ways to render the familiar environment, strange. This has required me to shift between the intimate insider stance to a more distanced stance to ensure rigour. I have enlisted the aid of reflective partners to assist me in this shift. Unlike the co-researchers of participatory or collaborative research who engage in the research for the purposes of testing their own theories (Lincoln & Denzin, 2000) the purpose of reflective partners has been to provide a foil for me to explicate my biases and assumptions in data analysis. The co-observers introduced earlier fulfilled the role of reflective partners in an extension of the data collection. This role has emerged as a result of early taped discussion with co-observers where I immediately identified a preliminary level of analysis in the verbal presentation of their observations. While I had anticipated taping what became known as Observational Dialogues, I had not anticipated their relevance for triangulation purposes. A key feature of the

Observation Dialogue in terms of triangulation has been the inclusion of two co-observers. This has enabled the discussion to flow to areas that I as researcher would not have created. This also addressed an early concern that I could unduly influence the co-observer toward my thinking. Through these dialogues I have been able to challenge my biases and assumptions. This system has also been instrumental in reflective discussions in which I have identified the themes that I have used to organise the data in the study and has exposed absent and dissenting voices regarding the themes24. This section explored my insider status and the way in which reflexive activity has contributed to the generation of data, transparency in analysis and trustworthiness in the findings and conclusions that the study reports.

**4.5** **Selecting the Site**

Implicit in ethnographic inquiry is the contextual nature of the study. This study has been contextualised in the 2002 performance program of my local Playback Theatre Company. This is my home-Company, based in my home-city of Brisbane, Australia. Brisbane is in

Queensland, the Sunshine State in Australia's North-East. Brisbane's population is 1.6 million.

It is Australia’s third largest city after Sydney and Melbourne. The Brisbane City Council (2004a) *OurBrisbane* website reports that before white settlement, Brisbane was home to the Jagera and Turrbal Aboriginal clans. The first white presence came with the Moreton Bay Settlement in 1824. Brisbane was freely settled from 1842, with entry to the national federation in 1901.

The average age of Brisbane’s population is thirty-three years, with twenty-one percent of the total population under the age of fifteen. The population is culturally diverse. Over twenty-six

percent of Brisbane’s population have been born overseas. In 1996 over fifteen percent of the population spoke a language other than English at home with Cantonese, Italian, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Greek, Spanish, German, Tagalog (Filipino), Polish and Russian being some of the most commonly spoken languages. Brisbane City Council website (2004b) reports that disability services, indigenous programs and culture, migrants and refugees, and youth are recipients of significant community service funding.

Choosing to undertake research in my home-Company in my hometown has been the hardest and easiest of decisions. Ely (1991) urges "that it is increasingly important to study the familiar" (p.17). Having been actively involved in the artistic and administrative operations of the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company for over nine years, it is very familiar to me. I have been a strong influence on the direction and the development of the Company. Yet, I have felt protective of the Company, and ambivalent about the prospect of exposing it. Choosing this 'site' has required me to overcome these concerns and enter a social environment that is dear to me, with the express intention of interrogating it. I am not a stranger (Agar, 1980) in this social world and my 'native' or insider status has maximised my access. Werner & Schoepfle (1987 in Ely, 1991) urge that in the move from studying "people who are different from us [to] those who exhibit much smaller, more elusive cultural differences … we must have methods that let us see even the most subtle departures from our expectations" (p.17). The way in which this has been addressed was discussed earlier in the chapter.

I have felt some uncertainty in asking people to get involved in this sticky business of ethnography, where they would inevitably be led to reflect on their own practice, and ask questions that often took the very fun that purportedly kept them doing Playback Theatre, out of the equation altogether. Colleagues25 and friends have encouraged me to consider my own community for work that required such interior scrutiny. I could not have asked for more generous support. As reported earlier, the idea of situating my research in my community of reflection has been further extended with the decision to include my partner, Dawn and my associates, Rebecca and Craig, as reflective partners and other friends as discussion group facilitators. A description of the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company is offered in Chapter Five.

Situating the study within the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company's performance commitments for 2002 has contained the research. Each Playback Theatre performance I have observed during the study has its own micro-context. Micro-context refers to the fact performances have been produced with a particular community or community event in mind, and thus audiences are "communities of identification" (Delanty, 2003), that is, they are composed of individuals affiliated through identifying contextual information, for example aboriginal reconciliation or mental health. The data sourced for this thesis has been derived from the eight performances26 documented in Chapter Five. By way of situating the reader at this stage of the thesis, these eight context-specific performances that generated data for the study are summarised below.

As suggested above the data collection has focused on the performances conducted by the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company. These performances have been generated in the conventional way in which the Company operates with the exception of the Reconciliation Performance (see Appendix 3). This performance has been produced especially for the research project in response to certain conditions the Company placed on me with respect to

video-documentation. In the preparations for this show, particular attention was given to audience participants' knowing beforehand that it was to be recorded and that it formed part of the data for a doctoral research project. The idea for a performance for

Reconciliation/Sorry Day had been simmering on the backburner of my own practice ambitions for a number of years. While in principle the Company has been interested in contributing to the broader social dialogue on reconciliation in Brisbane, we have no formal link to local aboriginal communities. The limits the Company placed on me (elaborated in the following section) have meant that I have had significant autonomy in bringing this idea to fruition.

The topic of reconciliation has been well supported by Company members, a number of whom work in the community sector or with other disenfranchised groups. Members of the Company had been very aware of the importance of the reconciliation debate. In a preparatory discussion with the Company, I expressed my concern that the reconciliation debate had gone quiet since the Tampa crisis28, with the national gaze falling more fully on refugees and asylum seekers. The Company members' responses indicated their good feeling about raising the topic for discussion in Brisbane at that time. A number of Company members have supported me as I thought through and prepared for the performance. This process has been essential in setting a clear pre-text, in effecting my own warm-up, and in guiding a number of decisions I have made about the show – decisions that have attended to the practice-research interface. On the one hand, I set about mounting a show that I had wanted to do for a number of years. I wanted it to succeed for the sake of future shows on

28 The captain of the Norwegian freighter, *Tampa*, acted in accordance with the mariners' humanitarian code and rescued 433 refugees from a sinking fishing boat in Australian waters in August 2001. They were within 2km from the coast of Christmas Island (an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean) when Prime Minister John Howard refused them entry. There were claims that Howard's actions were motivated by his ambition to win an upcoming election. Most of the Tampa refugees were redirected to the Pacific Island, Nauru, with others going to New Zealand. The Tampa crisis dominated local political debate and was prominent in the international arena until it was displaced by the shocking events of Sept 11. For a detailed analysis of the political manouvering underpinning the Tampa crisis, see Marr & Wilkinson's Dark Victory (2003).

this topic. On the other hand, the Reconciliation performance marked the beginning of the intensive stage of data collection. I wanted the research to be of a high standard. Both purposes have been significant in buoying my focus during data collection. The progressive steps of the data collection process are reported in the following section.

**4.7** **Data Collection**

The commencement of data collection has been a time of adjustment for me. Undertaking the dual roles of researcher and performer has heightened my experiences of performance. This has resulted in the stories that I witnessed and the people I met occupying my thoughts for days, longer than I have previously experienced. Often, the resonances have been persistent and interfered with my capacity to organise and analyse the data. In addition, my experience of the research process has been visceral and abstract. It has been an isolating time where I also felt alienated and disconnected within the Company due to the intensive nature of my Playback Theatre interest. In retrospect I feel delighted that my research design made demands that included reflective writing and the consequent discussions I had with my reflective partners. Through these dialogues I have often discovered ways to express my embodied knowledge, and my experience of the research process. In this section I give an account of the stages of data collection.

**4.7.1 Phase 1: Preliminary data collection phase**

Early on, the scope of my study was wide and this has led to three renegotiations of the line of inquiry. The first steps have been like a practice run (Ely, 1991). Interviewing two experienced practitioners29,30 who had recently performed in a Playback Theatre performance represented

29 'Experience' in this sense was defined by a number of criteria, most notably that the performer had a minimum of five years experience in the practice of Playback Theatre, and was still actively involved in Playback Theatre practice.

30 Unfortunately, this data tended toward a limiting process of trying to recall what happened from memory; rather than what their experience was and highlighted a common issue in practitioner reflection where experience is embodied and knowledge is tacit, and where opportunities for sense making are limited. For more discussion on this see Mattingly (1998).

this practice and has served as a pilot stage in the overall research journey (Pilot01). This data helped reorient my focus as the following journal entry states:

Listening to the tape of the interview I had with [two practitioners] after the last show I am beginning to question my idea that playbackers can shed new light on coming to terms with what happens. Ever since I listened to them again, I have been worrying constantly about entering the field. What is the field? How do I ask permission? From whom do I ask permission? No matter what happens, my research is going to effect people. It is not neutral. This helps me to get some distance. I think one of my biggest issues is my closeness to the form, to the participants. I have some way to go before I feel as though I have consolidated my research identity within the Playback Theatre community (Reflective journal,

August 21, 2001)

As the excerpt highlights, I had been cautious at the time. The second stage of data collection has resulted in an intensive period of in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of experienced31 practitioners. Preliminary analysis of the practitioner interviews has revealed significant limitations in terms of providing information about what happens in the Playback Theatre performance ritual beyond my own practice experiences32. This data has further served as background for the major data collection component of the study. It has assisted me to renegotiate the line of inquiry and narrow the focus of the study to that of audience perspectives of the performance experience. At this time, the Brisbane Company and the community-based context emerged as the site for the intensive phase of data collection. During this period, I have also consolidated the use of my own reflective processes as a data source. As the realities of the stages of data collection have surfaced, a more acute and deliberate researcher role has emerged for me.

31 By way of diversifying the sample I extended the criteria from the initial field visit to included a range of practice experiences - from 5-22 years; from performing to teaching and directing; and a range of practice locations, e.g., organisations; community; private practice. A total of thirteen interviews were conducted with practitioners from Companies in Eastern Australian capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania & Brisbane, New Zealand cities of Wellington, Auckland and Christchurch; and independent practitioners in Brisbane, Melbourne & Wellington.

32 By containing my study to these views I felt the risk of the study being overly self-referential was very high, and may have led the research report to read more like advocacy than critique. However, more significantly, practitioner reflection tended to be either focused on making better art; interrogating the texts of the performances; or theorising about why Playback Theatre does or does not 'work', rather than the 'what happens' angle of this project.

**4.7.2 Phase 2: Intensive data collection phase**

In order to carry out the data collection, I needed to establish permission to research within the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company and commence participant observation and informant interviews. The Company granted provisional permission to undertake some observation at the March public performance. Dawn and Rebecca attended as co-observers, with Rebecca also doing front-of-house. I performed as an actor in this performance. We also observed and approached participants for preliminary comments after the performance. I then arranged to pilot the informal interview process with one audience member who was familiar with Playback Theatre and a long-term supporter of the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company.

While I have found the participant observer role complex, co-observers found they became preoccupied with trying to remember the performance. The complexity of performance that I allude to at the opening of the chapter has resulted in limited observational notes in this early stage, with co-observers overly worried about accuracy of recall, and being unable to relax and reflect. This has led to a discussion about our experiences of observing. We all comment that we had found observing intense. My experience coincided with what van Maanen (1988) calls *thick* description with my observer perspective as an active performer embedded in the improvised Playback Theatre ritual, while simultaneously being embedded in the social situation of the Playback Theatre performance that I was hoping to document. Perhaps Malinowski's expression of the observer's dilemma best sums up what the three of us felt about trying to document our observations. His journal note says: "[i]f only I could somehow 'document' all this, I'll have valuable material" (in Wolcott, 1995, p.69).

Additional useful information emerging from this performance has revealed the after-show discussions as a rich source of data. The interview with the audience member has provided valuable insight into specific experiences of the Playback Theatre performance for the informant. This performance has appeared to primarily assist in refining the way in which I

came to implement the methods. Armed with this learning, I approached the Company to continue observational and interview activity, and seek permission to videotape the performances. Feeling nervous about asking, I turned to my journal. It states:

[I am] not wanting to use my influence, [I am] feeling shy and reluctant, possibly because I do not want to be rejected. … Bringing this request into the Company means I [am] showing more of myself than I have in the past - what will the consequences be? (Reflective journal, March 2002)

As a long-term and established member of Brisbane Playback Theatre Company I have been alert to the possibility that my leadership and artistic roles in the Company could influence their decision. It became clear that a formal letter of request was an appropriate method to inform the Company of my intention and to inquire about any conditions they wished to place on the research activity. This also provided a structure within which to discuss the research and its possible impact on the Company. They granted full permission with one exception.

This concerned my request to videotape the performances as a means to support memory recall and to capture other observational data. This essentially resulted in the negotiation to produce the Reconciliation performance for the purposes of videotaping. The consent and support of this initiative has been contingent on the condition that promotional material informs prospective audience participants that the performance is part of a research project (see Appendix 3). This is explained below.

I have been somewhat relieved by the Company members' thoughtful response to my request.

It demonstrated their concern for their audience and purpose while also supporting mine. Following this, the researcher role has 'enlarged' my presence in the Company and has had a greater impact on my social relationships with Company members than any of us could have predicted. Some Company members have become very engaged in the research and wanted to meet after the performance to reflect on the work. This acted to create an intense sub-group in the Company for a period of five months. Other Company members have been less involved in the intensity that the increased focus on our practice generated. This is of course, a natural outcome in these circumstances (Janesick, 2000). Despite this, Company members were supportive of the research. This took the form of ongoing access to the Company's performances for the remainder of the year33. My decision to abandon video documentation of the performances has been based on the relative insignificance of the data it generated in comparison to the intrusive and time-consuming nature of the process. A more naturalistic approach to data collection emerged in the latter part of the year. This is discussed further below.

While proper attention to the protocols at this stage has been essential, at times it felt as though starting data collection took forever. Ely (1991) reports that it could be "a longer, more active process than many of us envision" (p.23). This has certainly been my experience.

There were many times when I questioned whether or not I had actually started. The following journal entry reflects my relief at finding myself in the thick of observations, interviews and performances:

Here I am now, submerged. People to interview, notes to make, tapes to transcribe … I have well and truly started - all other aspects of my life are fading into the background (Reflective journal, July 18, 2002).

It has been an engrossing and fascinating time tinged with the odd feeling of futility brought about by the limitations I experienced in my capacity to document what I saw, heard and felt and the reductive nature of language. For example, how do I write about deeply embodied experiences when words seem too limited to express them? I have been so appreciative that I established co-observers. I have come to see how important it is that my presence has been framed deliberately, that the research activities have been structured and transparent, and that I have managed my research role and the additional reflective activity I engaged in so as not to overload the Company. As a "citizen scholar" (Saxton in Vidich & Lyman, 2000, p.59) it has been essential to be highly organised. This has included the specific support of co-observers,

33 Some Company members have continued to be excited by their involvement and interested in how locating the research within our practice contexts would enhance their experience of Playback Theatre.

discussion facilitators, and technical support (for the video recording). Performers also undertook a series of reflective dialogues after the Reconciliation performance, however, the time required for their ongoing reflexivity has meant this did not continue.

*The Reconciliation performance*

The Reconciliation performance was a milestone in the research. It has generated significant data and expanded the possibilities of the research. The audience discussions after the performance have revealed a high level of engagement with the theme, the Playback Theatre form and the idea of researching it (or perhaps the idea of talking about it). In the three after-show discussions more than half the audience added their voices to the tapes that have informed the direction of the thematic investigation. Engaged in my own reflexive process meant that my researcher reflection frames have consistently influenced my observational frames. Studies of this ilk are often deemed perception driven and thus shaped by researcher perspective, experience and personality (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994). The co-observers I selected have naturally different worldviews to me34. They reserved the right to hold skeptical opinions about the form. This has resulted in interpretive frames that were driven by more than just my perceptions.

As stated earlier, informant interviews have formed a large proportion of the data used in the construction of this thesis. The social environment of the Playback Theatre performance is essentially transient, contextualised and episodic. Audience engagement in this social environment is contingent on the complex interactive performance ritual. I became aware of the importance of sourcing diverse informants through the data generated from the

Reconciliation performance. For this performance, I developed a simple feedback page that

34 My assessment of the co-observers is that Craig's gaze has been concerned with what is happening on-stage, or what he has felt the audience members might be responding to on stage. Dawn seems more attuned to whether audience members have been engaged in the process. Rebecca is positioned somewhere in between the two.

asked audience members to state contact details so that I had the option to approach them beyond the performance. The feedback page, included as Appendix 4, was set alongside the front-of-house desk on a table at the venue. People were directed to the table and asked to complete a form for the purposes of the research. When teamed with observational data and discussion group data, the information proved extremely useful in selecting audience members for further interviews. For example, Craig, Dawn and I all had questions about the experiences of particular, yet different, audience members (see excerpt from the Observer Dialogue recorded after this performance in Appendix 5). Dawn suggests, if given a chance, she "probably would have spoken to [Juliet]" (OD01, L1495). While Craig says, "I’d go for Bea, because I was interested in her for some reason, still waters run deep" (OD01, L1499). I also nominate Darren who has expressed his disappointment in not telling his story in the discussion group. I also state my interest in Rebecca's friend Elizabeth, who has stated she had problems with the way stories featured.

After the Reconciliation performance the combination of data collection methods were established. Our observations, the group discussions, and (an amended) feedback form have assisted me to select and approach informants from future performances for interviews. The introduction of the feedback form has enabled audience members to indicate their interest in getting more involved in the research. The feedback form has also provided me with identifying information that guided me to informants with diverse experiences of Playback Theatre beyond what we ascertained from observation. The feedback form has also assisted me to check the accuracy of my observations with respect to audience member engagement.

Interestingly the co-observers and I found that our reading of audience members was either superficial or totally inaccurate when compared to what individuals have revealed in discussion groups or one-on-one interviews. An example of this was observations of relative inactivity of audience members as a group in the early stages of the Reconciliation performance. Variously

Dawn and Craig read this as disinterest, confusion or apprehension. On speaking with informants, individuals have recounted the considerable inner life that was occurring for them at the time. Another example was the obvious activity at the Pride performance. Dawn and I have both read this as an indication of a high level of engagement and general comfort with the process. Informant interviews have revealed the opposite with comments made about discomfort due to who was known in the audience, the presence of a baby, and the possibility that a story had been told for superficial reasons. The feedback form has also facilitated access to audience members with a range of experiences, including those who told stories, and those who did not, those who wanted to tell stories and those who did not, etc., with whom I have conducted interviews.

As I allude to above, participants were invited to join a conversation group immediately after the formalised part of the performance. Prior to the performance I had organised three Playback Theatre - savvy friends35 to assist me as discussion facilitators. Their role was to capture the immediate after-show interaction of audience participants on audiotape. The three groups that were convened after the Reconciliation performance had ten, seven and three participants respectively. Each group had a different focus during the discussion: one group were telling more stories, another group debated what reconciliation is and means, and the third expressed their experiences of the performance and the on-going resonances. There was also some inquiry about storytelling experiences36. The diversity within the discussion groups provided a wide canvas from which to draw for early patterns, adding to and challenging my ideas.

35 Thanks to Peter Howie, Ann Bermingham and Julie Newdick for your generosity and skill in facilitating these groups and later groups.

36 It was in the discussion group that Darren first revealed his discontent at not sharing his story and engaged in articulating the various reasons why he may have felt unable to tell.

At the completion of this first after-show contact, some participants consented to a follow-up interview. I had positive responses when I contacted audience members from the information they provided on the form. Many of them consented to participate further. People were generally delighted to be asked to speak about their experiences. Some elected not to continue involvement. Respondents were encouraged to use what Reinharz (1979) calls a storytelling style in interviews due to the conversational approach I used. Glover (2003) concedes that thinking about qualitative data as stories expands the possibility for the researcher (see also Polkinghorne, 1995). He proposes that, as researcher, I need to come to terms with the way in which research participants respond in interviews by telling stories that under the microscope of analysis could fail to present clear and useful thematic pointers at first glance. He suggests that rather than trying to deconstruct the stories told by research participants, I should treat them as "windows into the lived experience" of the participants, as "salient insights into the subjective realities" of the participants (p.146). Thinking of the data in this way has enabled me to engage with participants' stories from my own story of the incident that they were recounting. This has freed me from trying to divorce my researcher role from my experience of the social world of stories and performance that I had been steeped in. My role, therefore, felt like an extension of the Playback Theatre role in which they had previously encountered me. I have been required to listen, and in so doing, provide or create the necessary opportunity for people to tell stories about telling stories and about hearing stories, or to tell new stories. I have not used questions to guide the interviews, instead I invited people to continue to talk about what was bubbling up in them at the time. For others, I have undertaken a brief process of recalling the show, asking informants to speak about the stage of the performance that they felt most engaged. A new pattern that emerged in light of these first one-on-one conversations concerned the significance of the broader context in understanding audience members' responses to a Playback Theatre performance.

As reported earlier, I attempted to source additional data using videotape. Goldman-Segall (1998) recommends the usefulness of videotape for capturing detail that could otherwise be missed by a participant observer. However, as Mock (2000) suggests, the video evidence lacked the intensity of the 'live' performance and failed to make visible much that indicated the multiple and complex nature of audience members' experiences. The video-evidence has provided little, if any, insight into the experiences of individuals watching enactments, and listening to stories. It was decided that the complication of ensuring the performances were videotaped did not match the value of the material it delivered (Angrosino & Mays de Pérez 2000). The data sources for remaining performances have included discussion groups, individual conversations sourced through the informal feedback form, and observations, reflective writing and reflective discussions. By the September Public Performance the observational data was no longer introducing new information. At the final two performances I was oriented to unearthing information about the irregularities I had identified from the body of data, and absent voices I had overlooked. This process was guided by the specific use of the feedback form and informant interviews.

**4.8** **Data Analysis**

The nature of the data collection activities implemented in this study have demanded close and prolonged engagement with the social environment (Tedlock, 2000). Similarly, the methodology has demanded close and prolonged engagement with the data in analysis and interpretation. "Data analysis done simultaneously with data collection enables you to focus and shape the study as it proceeds" (Glesne, 1999, p.130). And so it was, with these processes essentially occurring simultaneously once the data collection was underway. The simultaneity of the stages has precipitated a discursive, yet somewhat systematic, progression through the performances. I have documented the parallel processes in Appendix 6. This section presents the processes undertaken to organise, interpret and extend the data during the course of the study.

As discussed in the data collection section, the preliminary phase of data collection served to focus the line of inquiry and point the intensive phase toward audience members' experiences and perceptions of the one-off community-based performance. I have conducted and transcribed all the interviews as part of my commitment to maintaining confidentiality and my desire to remain in the research process in an embodied way. To overcome the isolation and risk of self-referential analysis and interpretation as I listened to the tapes, I have written my reflections in my journal and periodically met with reflective partners. I have been interested to note how repetitive the content of the reflective writing has been and have come to better appreciate the iterative circular nature of analysis and interpretation. A number of thematic categories featured as early as the first week and kept emerging in various ways in the reflective writing. The journal is one long conversation with myself (Ely, 1991). It has served an important function in "moving the methodology and analysis forward", as Ely (1991, p.80) suggests, and has provided a site where I could begin to interrogate my thinking. One side of the dialogue has been like an ongoing stream-of-consciousness address to myself, while the other posed questions like, What else is happening? What is missing? Where am I in this? Who else do I need to ask? Sometimes the intensity of this inter-textual activity led me to feel unable to write. During these times, no amount of sitting at the desk would do. Booth, Colomb & Williams (1995) claims that this "kind of temporary aphasia … afflicts us when we try to write about matters we do not entirely understand" (p.29). Ely (1991) posits that this experience means that I had left the writing of that particular memo too late. She calls it an "input overload" and suggests that this is accompanied by a feeling of "floundering" because as researcher, I have not given myself the "direction" I need (p.80). I am more inclined to explain these times through my appreciation of the embodied nature of performance that Somerville alludes in the following quote:

Each individual has a unique point of view, with each experience difficult to articulate, due to the largely nonverbal, embodied and ephemeral nature of performance (Somerville, 1999).

This experience has similarly been discussed with respect to practitioners' attempts to articulate practice (Ely et al., 1997, Mattingly, 1998). Prior to this research experience I have often found myself turgid with my own embodied experience of the performance. Fox (1999b) speaks about the role of the conductor in the following way:

[B]ecause of their intensity, rituals place a heavy personal demand on their shamans, and it is essential to take time beforehand to assume the role and afterwards to release it (p.129).

In re-reading my observations and reflective notes I have been constantly aware that they lack a certain something that is present in the 'live' moment (Schartz & Walker, 1994, p.126). As I have moved from the making of my reflective notes to the using of them (Lederman in Wolcott, 1994), it has been the awkward drawings, the lists, the concept maps and poems that have often spoke loudest in terms of what is absent in the text rather than what is present.

Apart from a little specific transcription to inform my focus early on, the data collection and transcribing work have emerged as mutually exclusive activities for me. During the intensive data collection, I continued to perform, mainly in the role of conductor. In addition to the interactions and experiences usually associated with performing Playback Theatre I have engaged with audience members and players in order to maximise access to people for the research purposes. Conversely, transcription has occurred in front of the computer screen, ear pieces in. As I have listened I have been transported to a different time and place.

Transcriptions are word for word translations of the audiotape with some acknowledgement of gesture and tone of voice. This has required a high level of concentration. Transcribing has demanded a single mindedness as it is like a re-living of the original taped encounter. The following comment is from my journal:

As I listened to [the] conversation, I was immediately transported to that time … Black on white does not evoke the energy with which [we] spoke … or [the] thoughtfulness (Reflective Journal, March 2003).

There are forty-five interviews, five observer dialogues, the texts of eight performances, and twelve notebooks filled with observational and reflective notes. Samples of excerpts from the unedited transcripts and from my reflective journal are provided in the appendices (See Appendix 5). Verbatim excerpts in the findings chapter have been edited for readability.

Transcripts are identifiable using the following method. Interview transcripts have the informants' assumed names37, the performance code, and the transcript number. For example: Hillary, MHW06, L34 refers to something that Hillary said in the sixth interview from the Mental Health Week performance and the quote commences on line 34 of the transcript. For Observation Dialogues, I have used the similar system. For example, OD03, L91 refers to the third taped session with reflective partners, with the extract commencing on line 91 of the transcript. An example of the citation symbol I have used when citing performance text is: RecVT, L27. This refers to the Reconciliation Performance (video) transcript, line twenty-seven. I now turn my attention to the way in which I have worked with the transcribed interviews, observer dialogues and the reflective journal.

**4.8.1 Performing analysis, composing meaning**

When embarking on the organisation of data I found myself drawn to, and repulsed by the piles of transcripts and notes books. The fact was I had been making meaning since before collecting the preliminary data. In the previous section I allude to the intrinsic sense making activities that have occurred throughout the data collection. Each time I have encountered the data I have reconstructed the stories about the performances and the stories about particular informants from my perspective in that moment. This has been a recursive process that integrates why I was interested in the topic "in the first place" (Ely et al., 1997, p.20). The

purpose of the research has been to understand more about Playback Theatre from the perspectives of the audience. From the outset my purpose has been to engage with audience members and to make sense of what they say, in light of my experiences and the theory I have selected to frame the analysis. Ely et al. (1997) assert that humans are drawn to analyse. They state

There is no way as thinking human beings we can not analyse. The same human minds that think and remember and relive and retell in narrative also work with a different and sometimes contrary motion to classify and abstract (p.161).

This engagement in what Frank calls "the baggage of modernity," where one "retell[s] stories and then, like a good modernist, place[s] them into analytical frameworks" (Frank, 1995, p.23), has presented a number of challenges for me during the research. Frank (1995) claims that we "think with stories" (p.23). This has certainly been my experience from the preliminary analysis through to the end of writing. Glesne (1999) refers to this deep engagement with the data as entering the "code mines". She cautions that this work is "part tedium and part exhilaration". She states that the researcher has to move from telling stories to "making connections among the stories" (p.135). This has been challenging for me. By this time, my experience of "living with [the stories] and having them shape my perceptions" had become intense (Frank, 1995, p 24). I have had to find ways to transform my memories of the original stories so that the way in which they interacted with my story seemed new. It took time for them to "become mine" in the way Frank (1995) asserts is necessary if I am to write them into my manuscript. In all it has been a "highly personal sedimentation of experience" for me (Frank, 1995, p 24). The following reflective note expresses this experience:

It was hard for me in one sense because my Playback Theatre role was also one of inquiry and - while in my data collection I was focused on the social situation that was the performance - I was continually seduced by my curiosity as a Playback

Theatre practitioner with a commitment to expand my knowledge of particular cultural subgroups. When I was interviewing after a performance within the refugee (sector), I became distracted with the stories from informants as if the interview was an extension of the performance (Reflective Journal, Nov, 2002).

Glover (2003) asserts that researchers in this position might need to tell their own stories as they struggle to bring them to conscious awareness. Valuing this position has enabled me to tell and re-tell my story about being submerged in stories. The sessions with my reflective partners have facilitated this. Reflective dialogue sessions became what Atkinson and Coffey (1996) call knowledge production exercises. These have been shaped by our exchanging of stories and informed by our asking of questions. The reflexive component in the reflective dialogues has enabled me to focus beyond the "frequency of key words” approach to the themes in the transcripts (Glover, 2003, p.157). This liberated what Glover (2003) terms the fidelity of the narrative embedded in the transcript. This dialectic process between the integrity of the story and my interpretive frames has continued as I constructed the manuscript. At the time it surprised me that a dominant interpretative phase in the study has coincided with writing. The process of writing the thesis is discussed in the following section.

**4.8.2 Writing**

Constructing the thesis has been a continuation of the iterative dialectic process that permeated the research process. In interpreting and representing the data, I have sought to weave the lived experiences of informants with relevant literature and my own perspective.

The voice of the writer in ethnography is undeniable (van Maanen, 1988). By way of trustworthiness in the work I have assembled the thesis using multiple voices (Gergen & Gergen, 2000): the informants, the co-observers and researcher reflexive voice. Writing the thesis has been like a call and response between the data and the conceptual framework. I began to organise the data based on an assumption of the internal logic I had recognised in the words of the informants, then the literature would lead for a phrase or two, informant voices would then speak again as a *conversation-in-text* was constructed. While my insider's perception of reality has been "instrumental" in understanding and describing situations, the multiple gazes woven into the text of the thesis have helped to mediate the limitations of my insider position and compelled "the recognition and acceptance of multiple realities"

(Fetterman, 1998, p.20). Coffey and Atkinson (1996) term this a "dialogic methodology" (p.79). Atkinson, Coffey and Delamont (2003) assert that each voice used in an inter-textual document is reported with the informants' personal vocabulary. Bharucha (1993) makes a similar claim when he writes about language in the theatre. He asserts that "the words may not be the realities that they allude to and attempt to embody … they have their own materiality that reflects, however arbitrarily and obliquely, the world we live in" (p.45). The same has been true for my words as researcher and compiler of this report, with my words embodying my perceptions. Van Maanen (1988) suggests that:

The narrative and rhetorical conventions assumed by a writer also shape ethnography. Ways of personal expression, choice of metaphor, figurative allusions, semantics, decorative phrasing or plain speaking, textual organisation,

and so on all work to structure a cultural portrait in particular ways (p.5).

The next phase of sense making lies with you, the reader as you engage with the text from your perspective and make your own meaning, for as van Maanen (1988) describes: Meanings are not permanently embedded by an author in the text at the moment of creation. They are woven from the symbolic capacity of a piece of writing and the social context of its reception (p.25).

**4.8.3 Verification and Trustworthiness of Text**

As reported earlier, I have undertaken reflexive activities to maintain a critical stance in the study. This has translated to the writing phase, through the use of my reflective partners as I have organised data and constructed the two findings chapters. This has involved Kris and Dawn reading early versions of the chapters for the purposes of critiquing the organisation, and questioning assumptions and other things that they felt had been poorly substantiated.

Fine et al. (2000) assert that this process is only worthwhile if the disagreements in perspectives are reported. The influence of this process has emerged in the final selection of excerpts used to develop the thesis.

I have also employed a version of member checking (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998, Janesick, 2000) to ensure verification is also coming from informants. Most often, this has involved having audience members check the transcript of their interview. This has required them to comment on the transcript's accuracy, and add insight if verbatim representation of their voice lacked clarity. Janesick (2000) acknowledges that the researcher generally has authority when determining the form of checking research participants engage in. It is with the data that are selected to appear in the thesis or particular data that are spoken about in the thesis that I have been most concerned about. For these, I have approached participants to authorise the context of the excerpt. There have been some audience members who have not been interested in the on-going involvement that this required. For them, their contribution had been in the moment, connected to their performance experiences, not an experience of research. For others it created extra tension. One example of this is Asha's story. She had previously expressed concern over her story being considered in what she called the "public PhD context" (Mar03, L16). When approached with the transcript excerpt I was proposing to use, she states that she felt somewhat embarrassed by what she must have been feeling "back then". She said, "I can see that was me two years ago, but I don't think I would feel like that now". These concerns were eased after she considered the excerpt, as it was contextualised in the thesis (Mar06). Some participants have been unavailable for comment. Janesick (2000) suggests that this is not uncommon. For consistency and privacy, pseudonyms and minimum identifying material have been used in the manuscript.

**4.9** **Summary**

This chapter documents my research design. By considering the complexities of researching a *live* theatre event such a Playback Theatre I argue for a multi-method approach to the design. The ephemeral nature of performance coupled with my presence as an insider to the research context is critiqued and offered as a justification for this methodological direction. The various methods of observation, informant interviews, and researcher reflexivity are elaborated in the context of practice-based ethnographic research. I introduce the reader to the proposition of reflective journaling and reflective partners as the means by which I ensure trustworthiness of data and researcher transparency in the conduct of the fieldwork and the construction of the thesis. My experiences of the collection, analysis and interpretation of audience member interviews and observation data are recounted. This illuminates the reader to my encounters in the field and how these are translated into the inter-textual document that is this thesis.

The next three chapters present the findings. Chapter Five acts like a bridge to the findings. In it I establish the way in which the research site has been manifest in this study and introduce the reader to the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company. Descriptions of each performance are constructed as a means to position the reader in each specific context and familiarise them with the story content as they enter the inter-textual discussions documented in Chapters 6 & 7 - the findings and interpretations drawn from the performances.
