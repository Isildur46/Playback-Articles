# Abstract

# 摘要

In this study I explore the hybrid ritual performance form of Playback Theatre through audience members' experiences. The particular Playback Theatre application under consideration is the one-off community-based event. Selected writing from the Playback Theatre practice field assists in the establishment of the study focus. Literature from performance and ritual theory provides a framework for the inquiry. Theory about stories and storytelling offers a complementary lens that acknowledges the centrality of personal story in Playback Theatre. Contemporary writing about the experience of community is included to illuminate the experience of the public-private convergence in the Playback Theatre event. This study adds the voices of audience members to the writing about Playback Theatre from a practitioner perspective. The research has been undertaken using an ethnographic approach that draws on participant observation, informal group and individual interviews and researcher reflexivity.

在这项研究中，我通过观众的体验来探讨一人一故事剧场这种混合仪式表演形式。这里所讲的一人一故事剧场应用是一次性的、基于社群的活动。从一人一故事剧场实践领域选取的文献有助于确定研究重点。表演和仪式理论的文献为研究提供了一个框架。有关故事和讲故事的理论提供了一个补充视角，确证了个人故事在一人一故事剧场的核心地位。当代有关社区体验的著作也被纳入其中，以阐明一人一故事剧场活动中公共-私人交融的体验。本研究从实践者的角度出发，在有关一人一故事剧场的写作中加入了观众的声音。研究采用了人种学方法，借鉴了参与观察、非正式小组和个人访谈以及研究人员的反思性。

Audience members engage in the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance as participants and spectators. The study finds that the ritual framework offered by Playback Theatre is central to creating an environment for participation through the encouragement of flow experiences. Audience members' desire and capacity to participate is influenced by their initial engagement and their on-going negotiation of the tension of participation that is evoked through the repeated invitation implicit in the form. As participants, audience members' focus tends to be predominately on themselves as they resolve numerous responses to the invitation to participate. In order to accomplish this, many audience members engage in reflective distance, a momentary moving away from the liminal pull of the performance with the intention of re-entering. A resistance to surrendering to the invitation to participate challenges some audience members. The study identifies a number of barriers to participation.

观众以参与者和旁观者的身份参与基于社群的一人一故事剧场表演。研究发现，一人一故事剧场提供的仪式框架对于通过鼓励心流体验创造参与环境至关重要。观众的参与愿望和能力受到他们最初的参与和对参与紧张关系的持续协调的影响，而这种紧张关系是通过形式中隐含的反复邀请而唤起的。作为参与者，观众在解决对参与邀请的众多反应时，往往将注意力主要集中在自己身上。为了达到这一目的，许多观众都会进入反思距离，暂时远离表演的边缘拉力，意图重新进入。一些观众拒绝接受参与邀请，这给他们带来了挑战。研究发现了一些阻碍参与的因素。

The focus on self that the invitation to participate creates is transformed when a storyteller emerges from the audience, at which point, audience members shift to focus on the teller.

当讲故事的人从观众中出现时，邀请参与所产生的对自我的关注就会发生转变，此时，观众会将注意力转移到讲故事的人身上。

This constitutes a period of deep listening where audience members demonstrate a commitment to hearing the teller and appreciating the performers. While spectating, audience members experience connection to the teller and connection to the ideas presented in their stories. Watching the enactment they may have this experience expanded or heightened through the amalgamation of the multiple perspectives that the actors evoke as they interpret the story in the dramatised enactment. The collective experience of spectating yields multiple moments of communitas. This might be impeded if an individual has a persistent story they feel reluctant to tell or if an audience member is featured in a story told by another.

这是一个深度倾听的阶段，观众在这一阶段表现出聆听讲述者和欣赏表演者的决心。在观看过程中，观众会体验到与讲述者的联系，以及与故事中所表达的思想的联系。在观看表演时，他们的这种体验可能会通过演员在戏剧化表演中诠释故事时所唤起的多重视角的融合而得到扩展或加强。观看的集体体验会产生多种共通的时刻。如果一个人有一个不愿说出口的故事，或者一个观众在另一个人讲述的故事中出现，这可能会阻碍共通的连接。

The after-show period is shown to be an intrinsic part of the ritual event facilitating the incorporation of the experience for audience members as they prepare to re-enter the ordinary social world. This occurs through on-going storytelling and reflective discussion. The informal nature of this period is insufficient for some audience members who may require specific debriefing. The one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance is an opportunity for people to gather as a community and to tell and listen to stories. This requires an interactive process of risking and listening and provides audience members with an opportunity to see themselves and to see The Other. The study concludes that the application of Playback Theatre in this context is a metaphor for community.

演出结束后的时间是仪式活动的固有组成部分，有助于观众在准备重新进入日常社会世界时将体验融入其中。这是通过持续讲故事和反思性讨论实现的。这一阶段的非正式性质对于一些可能需要详细询问的观众来说是不够的。一次性的、基于社群的一人一故事剧场是人们作为一个社群聚集在一起讲述和聆听故事的机会。这需要一个冒险和倾听的互动过程，并为观众提供了一个看到自己和看到**他人**的机会。研究得出结论，在这种情况下应用一人一故事剧场是对社群的一种隐喻。

# Information for Readers

**Identifying Material**

**说明材料**

*Informants' Names*

*受访者姓名*

Informants' names have been changed for privacy and for consistency in the text. Initially, some informants elected to be identified. This felt congruent with the philosophy of the Playback Theatre process and the way in which participants are enabled to present themselves and their stories. Due to the contextual nature of the performance data, the decision has been made to change all names to avoid implicating others through identifying material associated with the named person.

为保护隐私和行文一致起见，对信息提供者的姓名进行了修改。起初，一些信息提供者选择不公开身份。这与一人一故事剧场的理念以及让参与者展现自我和故事的方式相一致。由于表演资料的背景性质，我们决定更改所有姓名，以避免因识别与被点名者相关的资料而牵连他人。

# My Story

# 我的故事

> We pass our culture and lore on through talking, through talking and the stories we tell through our bark paintings, and our performance, our song and dance performance. A combination of all three together (Wanyubi Marika, 2003)[1].
> 

> 我们讲述、传承我们的文化和传说，我们通过树皮画、表演，歌和舞的表演来讲述。三者结合在一起（Wanyubi Marika，2003 年）[1]。
> 

[1] Wanyubi Marika, is the brother of Mawalan I, the highly regarded leader of the Rirratjingu people of north-east Arnhem Land and a contributor to the famous Bark Petitions presented to the Australian federal government in the 1960s. The Marika Aboriginal dynasty is the oldest of the Australian dynasties, straddling two worlds in their bid to keep an ancient culture alive. They are acclaimed for giving Australia the closest thing to a Magna Carta, making the custodianship of land and culture its greatest strength.

[1] Wanyubi Marika 是 Mawalan I 的兄弟，Mawalan I 是阿纳姆地东北部 Rirratjingu 人备受推崇的领袖，也是 20 世纪 60 年代向澳大利亚联邦政府提交的著名树皮请愿书的撰稿人。马里卡原住民王朝是澳大利亚最古老的王朝，他们跨越两个世界，努力将古老的文化传承下去。他们赋予了澳大利亚最接近《大宪章》的东西，使土地和文化的监护权成为其最大的优势，因而备受赞誉。

When I first read these words by the great aboriginal elder of the Rirratjingu people of northeast Arnhem Land, I felt both grief and relief. The grief was associated with living what felt like the absence of a culture and lore tradition in my life, like the one embodied and lived by indigenous Australians. My relief came from knowing that in some way my experiences of Playback Theatre have been a medium through which I have come to acknowledge my own culture and lore tradition. Playback Theatre fuses two areas of interest for me: improvised performance and personal story. Previously, I have explored different theories on the place of story in the world. I have been drawn to conceptions of storytelling as liberatory, identity forming and self-making, and as a primary expressive vehicle for individuals and collectives (see earlier work, Dennis, 1999, 2000). Through stories, the tellers can learn about themselves and come to better know who they are. I have come to see that it is in the observing of and listening to others' stories that perhaps offers more to our world (Dennis, 2000, 2002). Stories have provided one way to know myself. Stories have provided a way for me to come to know others. In this research, I look beyond these experiences to the specific social context evoked in the Playback Theatre event and ask, what is happening?

当我第一次读到阿纳姆地东北部里拉金古族伟大的原住民长老所说的这些话时，我感到既悲痛又欣慰。悲痛的是，在我的生活中感觉缺少了一种文化和传说传统，就像澳大利亚土著人所体现和生活的那样。我的解脱来自于我知道，在某种程度上，我的一人一故事剧场经历是一种媒介，通过这种媒介，我开始承认我自己的文化和传说传统。一人一故事剧场融合了我感兴趣的两个领域：即兴表演和个人故事。此前，我曾探索过关于故事在世界上的地位的不同理论。讲故事是一种解放、身份形成和自我塑造的方式，也是个人和集体的主要表达方式（见早期作品，丹尼斯，1999 年，2000 年）。通过故事，讲述者可以了解自己，更好地认识自己。我逐渐发现，正是在观察和倾听他人故事的过程中，也许能为我们的世界提供更多的东西（丹尼斯，2000 年，2002 年）。故事提供了一种认识自己的方式。故事是我了解他人的一种方式。在这项研究中，我将目光投向一人一故事剧场活动所唤起的特定社会背景，并问道：发生了什么？

There have been times when I have made sense of my orientation toward performance and story by lamenting the absence of cultural and familial stories in my childhood. I am first generation Australian on my father's side. My father has been my only experience of Greek culture growing up. Despite this, I identify strongly with my Greek ethnicity. When I was young he chose not to speak Greek to us in his efforts to "fit in" and told too few stories about home. As a teenager, my understanding had been that he had had no contact with his family until his first return trip that year. I have since learned that he had kept in contact and sent money to help out, but this knowledge was not mine at the time. In fact, as a child I did not realise that we were Greek. It was an incident when I was about ten years old that introduced me to the idea of being different. Somewhat out of nowhere a girl at school called me a 'wog lesbian'. To her, the two words were interchangeable; to me they were totally unfamiliar. Guided by her tone of voice, I concluded that 'wog lesbian' was an undesirable thing to be. While the slur smarted like a slap on bare skin it fueled my curiosity about being "a wog" and served to mystify my father to me somewhat. *How come other people knew Dad was a wog and I didn't? Wasn't he just Dad*? It also awakened in me a consciousness about rights and privilege. Fourteen years later, when I visited Greece for the first time - an encounter with my own culture and lore - I came to understand that being Greek is intrinsic to who I am - passionate, energetic, Mediterranean.

有时，我也会感叹童年时代文化和家庭故事的缺失，从而理解自己对表演和故事的取向。我是我父亲这一脉的第一代澳大利亚人。父亲是我成长过程中唯一的希腊文化印记。尽管如此，我还是强烈认同自己的希腊血统。在我小的时候，他为了“融入”我们，不跟我们说希腊语，也很少讲家乡的故事。在我十几岁的时候，我的理解是，在他当年第一次回国之前，他与家人没有任何联系。后来我才知道，他一直和家里保持着联系，还寄钱给家里帮忙，但当时我并不知道这些。事实上，小时候我并不知道我们是希腊人。让我意识到自己与众不同的是我十岁时发生的一件事。学校里一个女孩突然叫我“鬼佬女同（wog lesbian）”。对她来说，这两个词可以互换；而对我来说，这两个词完全陌生。在她语气的引导下，我得出结论：“鬼佬女同”是一个不受欢迎的词。虽然这种蔑称就像一记耳光打在裸露的皮肤上，但却激起了我对成为“鬼佬（wog）”的好奇心，也让我对父亲产生了一些神秘感。*为什么别人都知道爸爸是个“鬼佬”，而我却不知道？他就不是我的爸爸吗？*这也唤醒了我对权利和特权的意识。14 年后，当我第一次访问希腊——与我自己的文化和传说相遇——时，我开始明白，希腊人的身份是我与生俱来的特质——热情、充满活力、地中海风情。

It is strange to me that I identify so strongly with my Greek ethnicity, when it seemed largely absent to me growing up. Instead of the likely colourful, intrusive, bossy Greek family life that might have been, it was my mother's large Anglo-Celtic family that surrounded us. Born tenth in a stream of seventeen children, my mother's family populated my childhood and the small rural town in which I lived. A strong memory for me is the tradition of afternoon tea with her sisters - lots of aunts and cousins and family gossip. Mum has always been a very beautiful woman and popular in her family, yet we were the only multiracial family in the larger Anglo-Australian family-context; Dad, the only European migrant and the only native Greek speaker. He seemed popular, yet I know he encountered racism and judgement within the family and the community. One of only four or five native Greek speakers in our town, his life demanded spontaneity and innovation.

令我感到奇怪的是，我如此强烈地认同自己的希腊血统，而在我的成长过程中，希腊血统在很大程度上似乎并不存在。我母亲的英裔凯尔特人大家庭围绕着我们，而不是可能存在的多姿多彩、干涉性强、专横的希腊家庭生活。在 17 个孩子中，我是第十个出生的，我母亲的家庭充斥着我的童年和我生活的农村小镇。给我留下深刻记忆的是和她的姐妹们一起喝下午茶的传统——有很多姨妈和表姐妹，还有很多家庭闲话。妈妈一直是个非常漂亮的女人，在家里很受欢迎，但我们是英澳大家庭中唯一的多种族家庭；爸爸是唯一的欧洲移民，也是唯一以希腊语为母语的人。他似乎很受欢迎，但我知道他在家庭和社群中遭遇了种族主义和评判。他是我们镇上仅有的四五个以希腊语为母语的人之一，他的生活需要自发和创新。

Embedded in these stories about my mother and father is some explanation of who I am and how I come to be researching a story-based performance form. As a performer and teacher of improvisation, spontaneity and innovation saying *yes and* to life is intrinsic to who I am and what I do. It is part of my embedded/embodied culture and lore. These experiences form part of the context for this thesis and guide me as I document the research. Another element of influence comes from the state of the world. The timing of my intensive data collection phase coincided with a 12-month period book-ended by two of the most shocking acts in the contemporary Australian experience. One, the invasion of New York and the fall of the twin towers, and the other, the attack on Bali's tourist district. Both events galvanised the Australian public and elevated our gaze beyond the backyard. It has been a time when more and more Australians have attended to the way in which Australia is placed in relation to other countries in the world – politically, socially, economically, geographically. There have been other incidences during this time that are equally terrible and where Australia is positioned as the aggressor rather than the aggrieved – the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and our refusal to receive refugees and asylum seekers to shore[2]. In a world such as this, I have felt drawn to make sense of and document some of what gives purpose to my life. Much of this is in the goodness, humility and generosity of the people I encounter through the practice and performance of Playback Theatre and the way in which they listen to one another and dare to share themselves with each other.

在这些关于我母亲和父亲的故事中，我解释了我是谁，以及我是如何开始研究以故事为基础的表演形式的。作为一名表演者和即兴表演教师，对生活说 *yes and* 的自发性和创新性是我的身份和工作的内在要求。这是我的内在的/具身的文化和传说的一部分。这些经验构成了本论文的部分背景，并在我记录研究过程中对我起到指导作用。另一个影响因素来自世界状况。在我密集收集数据的阶段，恰逢 12 个月内发生了两起当代澳大利亚人经历中最令人震惊的事件。一个是袭击纽约和双子塔倒塌事件，另一个是巴厘岛旅游区遇袭事件。这两起事件使澳大利亚公众为之一震，并让我们的目光提升到了后院之外。在这一时期，越来越多的澳大利亚人开始关注澳大利亚与世界其他国家在政治、社会、经济和地理上的关系。在此期间还发生了其他一些同样可怕的事件，在这些事件中，澳大利亚被定位为侵略者而非受害者——伊拉克战争和阿富汗战争，以及我们拒绝接受难民和避难者上岸[2]。在这样一个世界里，我感到自己被吸引，去理解和记录那些赋予我生命意义的东西。这在很大程度上体现在我通过一人一故事剧场的实践和表演所遇到的人们的善良、谦逊和慷慨，以及他们相互倾听和敢于分享自己的方式。

[2] This was not a one-off incident. For more about the recent history of the Australian policy on refugee access and entry see Theophanous (2001).

Performing has been a significant avenue for me to express my unique self and to feel vital and alive. When I perform Playback Theatre the essential aliveness of performance is woven with my essential self in relationship with many others. I am able to hear their stories and in doing so come to discover more about them as individuals and about the cultures that make up the tapestry that is Australian culture. Performing Playback Theatre demands that I continually interrogate my cultural assumptions. I have explored ways of challenging these assumptions through performance and reflection in collaboration with others. Through my explorations of and reflections on my performing practice, I better appreciate the profoundly raw embryonic culture and lore tradition that exists and is building in this nation – Australia. My reflective practice process has enriched me and has given me the impetus to undertake this research. Researching as a *real* participant observer in my own social (practice) world has resulted in a more dynamic interaction between practice and reflection. Hoogland (2003) suggests this increased intensity is due to my practice being "inextricably fused to my scholarship" (p.211). This inextricable fusing has yielded a research experience in which maintaining my practice roles alongside my roles as a researcher has been vital. Reflexivity has required that I interrogate my practice, or perhaps more accurately, it has demanded that I reconsider my practice behaviour, values, and assumptions (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000).

表演一直是我表达独特自我、感受生命活力的重要途径。当我表演一人一故事剧场时，表演的内在生命力和我的内在自我让我与许多人交织在一起。我能够聆听他们的故事，并从中发现更多关于他们个人和澳大利亚文化的信息。一人一故事剧场的表演要求我不断审视自己的文化假设。我与他人合作，通过表演和反思，探索挑战这些假设的方法。通过对表演实践的探索和反思，我更好地理解了澳大利亚这个国家已经存在并正在形成的深厚的原始文化胚胎和传说传统。我的反思性实践过程使我受益匪浅，也为我开展这项研究提供了动力。在我自己的社会（实践）世界中，作为一个*真正的*参与者观察者进行研究，使实践与反思之间的互相促进更加活跃。霍格兰（Hoogland，2003 年）认为，这种强度的增加是由于我的实践“与我的学术研究密不可分地融合在一起”（第 211 页）。这种密不可分的融合产生了一种研究体验，在这种体验中，保持我的实践角色和研究者角色至关重要。反思性要求我审视自己的实践，或者更准确地说，它要求我重新考虑自己的实践行为、价值观和假设（Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000）。

At times, the in-depth scrutiny of my Playback Theatre work has effected my spontaneity and diminished my capacity to appreciate the creative work of others and mine as good enough. I have experienced moments when my sense of play diminished and feelings of disconnection and isolation swamped me as I grappled with the conflicting agendas (and values) of a creative (group) artist and a (solo) scholar. In reading this thesis, you accompany me on my journey and witness my discoveries as I encounter Playback Theatre through the experiences of audience members in the liminal spaces of the research in my local community.

有时，对一人一故事剧场工作的深入审视影响了我的自发性，削弱了我欣赏他人和我的创造性工作的能力。我曾经历过游戏感减弱的时刻，也曾经历过断裂感和孤独感淹没我的时刻，因为我在努力应对一个创造性（团体）艺术家和一个（个人）学者的议程（和价值观）之间的冲突。在阅读这篇论文的过程中，您将陪伴我走过这段旅程，见证我在当地社群的研究边缘空间中通过观众的体验与一人一故事剧场相遇时的发现。

# CHAPTER ONE: Introduction

# 第一章：引言

> We have inherited a civilization in which the things that really matter in human life exist at the margin of our culture. What matters? How birthing takes place matters; how infants are raised matters; having a rich and active dream life matters. Animals matter, and so does ontological security and the magic of interpersonal interactions and healthy and passionate sexual expression. Career and prestige and putting a good face on it and the newest fashion in art or science do not matter. Coming to our senses means sorting this out once and for all. It also means becoming embodied. And the two ultimately amount to the same thing.
Morris Berman (1990, p.341-2).
> 

> 我们继承了一种文明，在这种文明中，人类生活中真正重要的东西存在于我们文化的边缘。什么东西是重要的？如何分娩很重要；如何抚养婴儿很重要；拥有丰富而活跃的梦想生活很重要。动物很重要，本体论的安全感、人际交往的魅力以及健康而充满激情的性表达也很重要。事业、声望、面子以及艺术或科学领域的最新时尚并不重要。理智意味着我们要一劳永逸地解决这些问题。这也意味着我们要具身。这两者最终是一回事。
莫里斯-伯尔曼（1990 年，第 341-2 页）。
> 

In this critique of contemporary humanity, Berman (1990) proposes that life-giving experiences have been relegated to the margins of dominant culture. In this thesis I investigate a hybrid artform that sits comfortably on the margins because of what it can illuminate there.

在对当代人类的这一批判中，伯尔曼（1990 年）提出，赋予生命的体验已被置于主流文化的边缘。在这篇论文中，我研究了一种混合艺术形式，这种艺术形式因其所能揭示的内容而被舒适地置于边缘地带。

The Playback Theatre form offers a contemporary ritual framework from within which individuals can engage with one another at the margins and pursue the magical interactions that Berman claims as life giving. A story-based performance form, Playback Theatre is derivative of the oral tradition merging culturally relevant arts with sacred ritual, personal story and community gatherings. My experiences of performing in and producing Playback Theatre have resulted in some understanding of its potential to build connections between people. I have also come to a growing awareness of the possible gaps and limitations in the method and my practice of it. This study has been derived from this awareness, and seeks to understand Playback Theatre from the experience of participants who dare to engage at the margins though this performance experience.

一人一故事剧场形式提供了一个当代仪式框架，在此框架内，个人可以在边缘地带相互接触，并追求伯尔曼所说的赋予生命的神奇互动。一人一故事剧场是一种基于故事的表演形式，是口述传统的衍生物，将与文化相关的艺术与神圣的仪式、个人故事和社群聚会融合在一起。我在一人一故事剧场中的表演和制作经验使我对其在人与人之间建立联系的潜力有了一定的了解。同时，我也逐渐意识到这种方法和我在实践中可能存在的差距和局限性。本研究正是源于这种认识，并试图从敢于在边缘参与一人一故事剧场的参与者的经历中了解这种表演体验。

The study focuses on the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance. This containment of the field of inquiry has facilitated an exploration of this specific public event. Popular for over thirty years, the one-off performance has yet to receive adequate attention in terms of its value and purpose. This study provides some remedy to this situation.

本研究的重点是一次性的、基于社群的一人一故事剧场。这种对研究领域的限制促进了对这一特定公共活动的探索。一次性的表演已流行了三十多年，但其价值和目的尚未得到足够的重视。本研究对这种情况进行了一些补救。

本研究的目的是：

- explore what happens in a Playback Theatre event from the audience members' perspective; and
- attempt ways of describing what Playback Theatre does so that it may be applied with greater integrity.

- 从观众的角度探索一人一故事剧场活动中发生了什么；以及
- 尝试描述一人一故事剧场的作用，使其在应用时更具完整性。

The research aims to frame the practice of Playback Theatre beyond the often self-referential frames that are a feature of the writing about Playback Theatre. It adds the voices and perceptions of audience members to Playback Theatre scholarship, specifically with relation to the one-off context-based performance. Finally, as an inquiry into audience experience the research process seeks to articulate ways in which people participate in the Playback Theatre ritual; the impact of telling, listening and watching the stories as they unfold; and how the experience equates to an experience of community for participants.

这项研究旨在为一人一故事剧场的实践提供框架，使其超越一人一故事剧场的相关文章中经常的自我指涉的框架。将观众的声音和看法加入到一人一故事剧场的学术研究中，特别是和一次性的、与基于背景（context）的一人一故事剧场的关联。最后，作为对观众体验的探究，研究过程试图阐明一人一故事剧场仪式的参与方式；讲述、聆听和观看故事所产生的影响；以及这种体验如何等同于参与者的社群体验。

## 1.2 Method

## 1.2 方法

The study seeks to better understand the process of Playback Theatre through the experience of individuals. An exploratory ethnographic approach has been implemented using informant interviews, observation and researcher reflexivity. Early interviews with practitioners and preliminary observational and reflexive data have served to direct the study toward the experiences of audience members. The context for the study is derived from the specific contexts of the performance work enacted by The Brisbane Playback Theatre Company of which I am a member.

本研究试图通过一人一故事剧场的体验来更好地了解其过程。本研究采用了一种探索性的人种学方法，利用信息访谈、观察和研究者的反思性。对从业人员的早期访谈以及初步的观察和反思数据有助于将研究引向观众的体验。本研究的背景来自于布里斯班一人一故事剧团（The Brisbane Playback Theatre Company）的特定表演环境。

## 1.3 Findings

## 1.3 研究結果

The study findings indicate that audience members come to the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performances for different reasons. Motivation to attend is mostly due to audience members' identification with the context within which the performance is placed, for example, mental health week. Participants also attend because of their familiarity with the form. Audience members engage as participants and spectators. During performances, they actively engage in a personal process of deciding whether to participate and in what way. Simultaneously, they are engaged in experiencing the theatre event and in the appreciation of the performances of the storytellers and the performers. For some, participation extends to include their telling of a personal story. There are numerous reasons why people choose to tell a story during the Playback Theatre performance. People also choose not to tell. Whether the participant chooses to tell or decides against telling, their decision is influenced by their personal values. Many factors conspire to influence whether a person will tell a story or not.

研究结果表明，观众观看基于社群的一人一故事剧场演出的原因各不相同。参加演出的动机主要是观众对演出背景的认同，例如精神健康周。参加者也会因为熟悉这种表演形式而出席。观众既是参与者，也是观众。在表演过程中，他们积极地参与到决定是否参与以及以何种方式参与的个人过程中。同时，他们还参与体验戏剧活动，欣赏故事讲述者和表演者的表演。有些人的参与还包括讲述个人故事。在一人一故事剧场演出中，人们选择讲述故事的原因有很多。也有人选择不讲故事。无论参与者选择讲述还是决定不讲述，他们的决定都受到其个人价值观的影响。影响一个人是否讲述故事的因素很多。

The experience of watching the enactments inspired by the personal stories has been shown to be a key point of audience engagement. Audience members claim to have seen something new, to have been influenced by multiple perspectives, and to have been prompted to reconsider their views of the person telling the story, the people represented in the enactment, or the ideas presented in the story/enactment. In this way, people have a collective experience in which they interact with people they may otherwise never meet, or come to know.

事实证明，观看由个人故事激发的表演是观众参与的关键点。观众声称看到了新的东西，受到了多角度的影响，并促使他们重新考虑自己对故事讲述者、表演中代表的人物或故事/表演中提出的观点的看法。通过这种方式，人们获得了一种集体体验，在这种体验中，他们与自己可能从未见过或认识的人进行了互动。

The study finds that audience members engage in a process of moving in and out of the liminal space of the performance. The nontraditional nature of the form and the highly ritualised structure of the performance activate this experience. The individual undertakes a form of critical reflection and engages in the constant comparison of their actual experience of the event with that which they had expected, and the ongoing consideration of the way in which the form intersects with their values. This results in audience members continually renegotiating their relationship to the values and ideas implicit in the form, particularly that of participation, and the mixing of the personal/public selves. The reflective experience extends beyond the formal performance frame.

研究发现，观众参与了一个在表演的边缘空间进出的过程。表演形式的非传统性和高度仪式化的结构激活了这种体验。观众个体会进行一种批判性的反思，不断将自己的实际体验与预期体验进行比较，并持续思考表演形式与自身价值观的交集。这导致观众不断重新协调他们与这种形式所蕴含的价值观和理念的关系，特别是参与和个人/公共自我的混合。反思体验超越了正式表演的框架。

The research makes recommendations for purposeful and strategic Playback Theatre work. It proposes that Playback Theatre has a place in contemporary community life because it gives form and structure to that marginal space Berman names in the opening quote, a space where people can meet. The findings in this study provide a framework for the production of viable one-off Playback Theatre events. The study also makes recommendations for practitioner formation and development. Recommendations for further research are listed.

研究为一人一故事剧场工作的目的性和战略性提供了建议。它提出，一人一故事剧场在当代社群生活中占有一席之地，因为它为伯尔曼在开篇引言中提到的边缘空间提供了形式和结构，一个人们可以相遇的空间。本研究的结论为制作可行的一人一故事剧场活动提供了一个框架。本研究还为从业者的培养和发展提出了建议。此外，还列出了进一步研究的建议。

## 1.4 How the Thesis is Organised

## 1.4 论文的组织结构

The thesis opens with *My Story.* This is designed to situate the reader and tells some of my story. It is written to shed light on how my family history, my life experiences and my love of improvising converge in my practice of Playback Theatre and have led to this research project.

论文以*我的故事*开篇，旨在为读者定位，并讲述我的一些故事。写这个故事是为了阐明我的家族史、我的生活经历和我对即兴表演的热爱是如何在一人一故事剧场的实践中交汇在一起，并促成了这一研究项目的。

Chapter One – Here, I introduce the thesis and state my research questions. I provide a summary of the research design, articulate the study findings and present an outline of the way the thesis is organised.

第一章——此处，我将介绍本论文并阐述我研究的问题。我概述了研究设计，阐明了研究结果，并介绍了论文的组织方式。

Chapter Two – This chapter presents relevant literature on Playback Theatre. Titled *Presenting Playback Theatre,* it introduces the interactive performance form and recounts the historical development of the Playback Theatre movement. The chapter deconstructs the Playback Theatre method through the framework of context, form and content, and establishes it as a form of ritual performance that has application in community-based contexts. The emergence of research and scholarship in Playback Theatre is interrogated. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the thesis extends the knowledge of the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based ritual event.

第二章——本章介绍一人一故事剧场的相关文献。本章以*一人一故事剧场的呈现*为题，介绍了一人一故事剧场这种互动表演形式，并讲述了一人一故事剧场运动的历史发展。本章通过背景、形式和内容的框架解构了一人一故事剧场的方法，并将其确立为一种基于社群的仪式表演形式。本章对一人一故事剧场研究和学术研究的兴起进行了探讨。本章最后讨论了论文如何扩展了对一人一故事剧场作为一次性的、基于社群的仪式活动的应用的认识。

Chapter Three – The *Review of Literature* chapter documents the fields from the literature that I determine provide useful framing of the study: performance theory, ritual theory, community theory and theory about story and storytelling. Performance theory is presented as the broad context for this thesis. The notion of performance as a rhythmic or systematic process that contains personal and communal expression in a public forum is explored through ritual and ritual performance theory. Here I propose that the liminal activity of ritual performance and the subsequent experience of flow are useful concepts when speaking about audience engagement and audience experience of Playback Theatre. I extend this to include the act of storytelling as a ritual performance. By way of framing the study's focus on community-based activity, I draw on literature exploring relevant concepts of community. Turner's (1969) conception of communitas provides a link back to the previous fields of literature and enables a discussion about experiences of community. Ideas such as diversity, estrangement and The Other are incorporated in the conception of community. The final field in the literature is that of story. While the study does not attempt to interrogate the vast potential of story and storytelling in Playback Theatre, this theory provides essential framing for the study with respect to story and storytelling due to the central place of personal story in the Playback Theatre form. This chapter ends with discussion of how these literature fields interact to form the conceptual framework of the thesis.

第三章——*文献综述*记录了我认为能为研究提供有用框架的文献领域：表演理论、仪式理论、社群理论以及关于故事和讲故事的理论。表演理论是本论文的大背景。表演是一个有节奏或有系统的过程，包括了公共场合的个人和社区表达，这一概念通过仪式和仪式表演理论进行了探讨。此处，我提出，仪式表演的边缘活动和随后的心流体验是谈论一人一故事剧场的观众参与和观众体验时的有用概念。我将其延伸到作为仪式表演的讲故事行为。通过将研究重点放在基于社群的活动上，我借鉴了探讨社群相关概念的文献。特纳（Turner，1969 年）的 “社群”（communitas）概念提供了与前几种文献领域的联系，使我们能够讨论社群的经验。多样性、隔阂和**他者**等概念都被纳入了社群的概念中。虽然本研究并不试图探讨故事和讲故事在一人一故事剧场中的巨大潜力，但由于个人故事在一人一故事剧场中的核心地位，这一理论为本研究提供了有关故事和讲故事的重要框架。本章最后讨论了这些文献领域如何相互作用，从而形成论文的概念框架。

Chapter Four – Dedicated to the *Methodology* this chapter opens with a consideration of what the researching of performance entails. It describes the multi-method approach I have implemented by illustrating how the ethnographic methods of observation and informant interviews have been combined with researcher reflexivity in the research process. The reader is introduced to the reflexive activity of reflective journaling and to my use of discussions with designated reflective partners. How the elements of researcher subjectivity and trustworthiness of data have been managed in the construction of the thesis is also documented. Finally I describe the process undertaken to collect, analyse and report the data.

第四章——*方法论*首先讨论了表演研究的内涵。本章介绍了我所采用的多种方法，说明了在研究过程中如何将观察和信息访谈等人种学方法与研究者的反身性相结合。向读者介绍了写反思日记的反思活动，以及我与指定的反思伙伴进行讨论的方法。此外，还介绍了在撰写论文过程中如何处理研究人员的主观性和数据的可信度等因素。最后，我描述了收集、分析和报告数据的过程。

Chapter Five – In this chapter I establish the way in which the research site has been manifest in this study. I present the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company and their 2002 Performances. The chapter elaborates on the performances from which the data that is featured in the study have been generated. Chapter Five acts as a bridge to the findings chapters. Predominantly descriptive in nature, its purpose is to locate readers as they embark on reading the study findings.

第五章——在本章中，我确定了研究地点在本研究中的体现方式。我介绍了布里斯班一人一故事剧团及其 2002 年的演出。本章详细介绍了演出情况，本研究中的数据就是从这些演出中产生的。第五章是连接研究结果章节的桥梁。该章主要是描述性的，其目的是在读者开始阅读研究结果时为他们定位。

Chapter Six – This is the first of two chapters reporting the study findings in an inter-textual account of what audience members have revealed about their experiences of the Playback Theatre performance. In *Crossing the Threshold,* Ichart the journey of audience members as they encounter Playback Theatre during the preliminary stages of the performance. I report on how their preparation for and expectations of the event influence their initial engagement. The chapter then examines the various elements confronting audience members as they weigh up the prospect of participating. Audience members' experiences of participating are presented. I write about the experience of reflective distance and report on those things that inhibit participation.

第六章——这是两章中的第一章，以跨文本的方式报告了研究结果，讲述了观众对一人一故事剧场演出的体验。在*跨越门槛*中，我描绘了观众与一人一故事剧场在演出前期相遇的过程。我报告了他们对活动的准备和期望如何影响他们最初的参与。然后，本章探讨了观众在权衡参与的可能性时所面临的各种因素。本章介绍了观众的参与体验。我写了反思距离的体验，并报告了那些抑制参与的因素。

Chapter Seven – In the second of the findings chapters, *"Let's Watch!",* I combine data with my subsequent interpretation to present the audience members' experience of spectating at the Playback Theatre performance. I collate a number of examples to illustrate the experience of connection for audience members as they listen to the personal stories and watch the dramatic enactments. The exhilaration of heightened connection, the disappointment of a missed connection, and the confusion of an unexpected connection is also discussed. The way in which individuals may gain a different perspective on themselves and on others is considered. The chapter ends with discussion about audience participants' experiences of the after-show period.

第七章——在研究结果的第二部分，*“请看！”*中，我将数据与后续的解读结合起来，介绍了观众在一人一故事剧场观看演出时的体验。我整理了一些例子来说明观众在聆听个人故事和观看戏剧表演时的连接体验。此外，我还讨论了增强连接的兴奋、错过连接的失望以及意外连接的困惑。本章还讨论了个人如何从不同的角度看待自己和他人。本章最后讨论了观众参与者在演出结束后的体验。

Chapter Eight – In this concluding chapter I summarise the research findings and present my propositions for purposeful and strategic Playback Theatre practice and the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based event. My recommendations for further research are included. The chapter concludes with the proposition that the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based event represents an experience of community for audience members.

第八章——在这一总结性章节中，我总结了研究结果，并提出了有目标的、有策略的一人一故事剧场实践建议，以及将一人一故事剧场作为一次性的、基于社群的活动的应用建议。本章还包括我对进一步研究的建议。本章最后提出的主张是，将一人一故事剧场作为一次性的、基于社群的活动，对观众而言是一种社群体验。
