# Abstract

In this study I explore the hybrid ritual performance form of Playback Theatre through audience members' experiences. The particular Playback Theatre application under consideration is the one-off community-based event. Selected writing from the Playback Theatre practice field assists in the establishment of the study focus. Literature from performance and ritual theory provides a framework for the inquiry. Theory about stories and storytelling offers a complementary lens that acknowledges the centrality of personal story in Playback Theatre. Contemporary writing about the experience of community is included to illuminate the experience of the public-private convergence in the Playback Theatre event. This study adds the voices of audience members to the writing about Playback Theatre from a practitioner perspective. The research has been undertaken using an ethnographic approach that draws on participant observation, informal group and individual interviews and researcher reflexivity.

Audience members engage in the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance as participants and spectators. The study finds that the ritual framework offered by Playback Theatre is central to creating an environment for participation through the encouragement of flow experiences. Audience members' desire and capacity to participate is influenced by their initial engagement and their on-going negotiation of the tension of participation that is evoked through the repeated invitation implicit in the form. As participants, audience members' focus tends to be predominately on themselves as they resolve numerous responses to the invitation to participate. In order to accomplish this, many audience members engage in reflective distance, a momentary moving away from the liminal pull of the performance with the intention of re-entering. A resistance to surrendering to the invitation to participate challenges some audience members. The study identifies a number of barriers to participation.

The focus on self that the invitation to participate creates is transformed when a storyteller emerges from the audience, at which point, audience members shift to focus on the teller.

This constitutes a period of deep listening where audience members demonstrate a commitment to hearing the teller and appreciating the performers. While spectating, audience members experience connection to the teller and connection to the ideas presented in their stories. Watching the enactment they may have this experience expanded or heightened through the amalgamation of the multiple perspectives that the actors evoke as they interpret the story in the dramatised enactment. The collective experience of spectating yields multiple moments of communitas. This might be impeded if an individual has a persistent story they feel reluctant to tell or if an audience member is featured in a story told by another.

The after-show period is shown to be an intrinsic part of the ritual event facilitating the incorporation of the experience for audience members as they prepare to re-enter the ordinary social world. This occurs through on-going storytelling and reflective discussion. The informal nature of this period is insufficient for some audience members who may require specific debriefing. The one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance is an opportunity for people to gather as a community and to tell and listen to stories. This requires an interactive process of risking and listening and provides audience members with an opportunity to see themselves and to see The Other. The study concludes that the application of Playback Theatre in this context is a metaphor for community.

# Information for Readers

**Identifying Material**

*Informants' Names*

Informants' names have been changed for privacy and for consistency in the text. Initially, some informants elected to be identified. This felt congruent with the philosophy of the Playback Theatre process and the way in which participants are enabled to present themselves and their stories. Due to the contextual nature of the performance data, the decision has been made to change all names to avoid implicating others through identifying material associated with the named person.

*Explanation of codes used for quoted material.*

The content of this thesis is based on personal testimony and observation. Throughout the thesis I use excerpts from the interview transcripts, the performance transcripts and the reflective journal. These excerpts are edited to maximise ease of reading. The appendices show samples of unedited transcripts from each data. Quoted materials not included in appendices are stored on CD-ROM and are catalogued in identical fashion to what is shown in the samples. For an explanation of the way in which direct quotes are identified see Chapter 4.

# My Story

We pass our culture and lore on through talking, through talking and the stories we tell through our bark paintings, and our performance, our song and dance performance. A combination of all three together (Wanyubi Marika, 2003)[1].

[1] Wanyubi Marika, is the brother of Mawalan I, the highly regarded leader of the Rirratjingu people of north-east Arnhem Land and a contributor to the famous Bark Petitions presented to the Australian federal government in the 1960s. The Marika Aboriginal dynasty is the oldest of the Australian dynasties, straddling two worlds in their bid to keep an ancient culture alive. They are acclaimed for giving Australia the closest thing to a Magna Carta, making the custodianship of land and culture its greatest strength.

When I first read these words by the great aboriginal elder of the Rirratjingu people of northeast Arnhem Land, I felt both grief and relief. The grief was associated with living what felt like the absence of a culture and lore tradition in my life, like the one embodied and lived by indigenous Australians. My relief came from knowing that in some way my experiences of Playback Theatre have been a medium through which I have come to acknowledge my own culture and lore tradition. Playback Theatre fuses two areas of interest for me: improvised performance and personal story. Previously, I have explored different theories on the place of story in the world. I have been drawn to conceptions of storytelling as liberatory, identity forming and self-making, and as a primary expressive vehicle for individuals and collectives (see earlier work, Dennis, 1999, 2000). Through stories, the tellers can learn about themselves and come to better know who they are. I have come to see that it is in the observing of and listening to others' stories that perhaps offers more to our world (Dennis, 2000, 2002). Stories have provided one way to know myself. Stories have provided a way for me to come to know others. In this research, I look beyond these experiences to the specific social context evoked in the Playback Theatre event and ask, what is happening?

There have been times when I have made sense of my orientation toward performance and story by lamenting the absence of cultural and familial stories in my childhood. I am first generation Australian on my father's side. My father has been my only experience of Greek culture growing up. Despite this, I identify strongly with my Greek ethnicity. When I was young he chose not to speak Greek to us in his efforts to "fit in" and told too few stories about home. As a teenager, my understanding had been that he had had no contact with his family until his first return trip that year. I have since learned that he had kept in contact and sent money to help out, but this knowledge was not mine at the time. In fact, as a child I did not realise that we were Greek. It was an incident when I was about ten years old that introduced me to the idea of being different. Somewhat out of nowhere a girl at school called me a 'wog lesbian'. To her, the two words were interchangeable; to me they were totally unfamiliar. Guided by her tone of voice, I concluded that 'wog lesbian' was an undesirable thing to be. While the slur smarted like a slap on bare skin it fueled my curiosity about being "a wog" and served to mystify my father to me somewhat. *How come other people knew Dad was a wog and I didn't?Wasn't he just Dad*? It also awakened in me a consciousness about rights and privilege. Fourteen years later, when I visited Greece for the first time - an encounter with my own culture and lore - I came to understand that being Greek is intrinsic to who I am - passionate, energetic, Mediterranean.

It is strange to me that I identify so strongly with my Greek ethnicity, when it seemed largely absent to me growing up. Instead of the likely colourful, intrusive, bossy Greek family life that might have been, it was my mother's large Anglo-Celtic family that surrounded us. Born tenth in a stream of seventeen children, my mother's family populated my childhood and the small rural town in which I lived. A strong memory for me is the tradition of afternoon tea with her
sisters - lots of aunts and cousins and family gossip. Mum has always been a very beautiful woman and popular in her family, yet we were the only multiracial family in the larger Anglo-Australian family-context; Dad, the only European migrant and the only native Greek speaker. He seemed popular, yet I know he encountered racism and judgement within the family and the community. One of only four or five native Greek speakers in our town, his life demanded spontaneity and innovation.

Embedded in these stories about my mother and father is some explanation of who I am and how I come to be researching a story-based performance form. As a performer and teacher of improvisation, spontaneity and innovation saying *yes and* to life is intrinsic to who I am and what I do. It is part of my embedded/embodied culture and lore. These experiences form part of the context for this thesis and guide me as I document the research. Another element of influence comes from the state of the world. The timing of my intensive data collection phase coincided with a 12-month period book-ended by two of the most shocking acts in the contemporary Australian experience. One, the invasion of New York and the fall of the twin towers, and the other, the attack on Bali's tourist district. Both events galvanised the

Australian public and elevated our gaze beyond the backyard. It has been a time when more and more Australians have attended to the way in which Australia is placed in relation to other countries in the world – politically, socially, economically, geographically. There have been other incidences during this time that are equally terrible and where Australia is positioned as the aggressor rather than the aggrieved – the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and our refusal to receive refugees and asylum seekers to shore[2]. In a world such as this, I have felt drawn to make sense of and document some of what gives purpose to my life. Much of this is in the goodness, humility and generosity of the people I encounter through the practice and performance of Playback Theatre and the way in which they listen to one another and dare to share themselves with each other.

[2] This was not a one-off incident. For more about the recent history of the Australian policy on refugee access and entry see Theophanous (2001).

Performing has been a significant avenue for me to express my unique self and to feel vital and alive. When I perform Playback Theatre the essential aliveness of performance is woven with my essential self in relationship with many others. I am able to hear their stories and in doing so come to discover more about them as individuals and about the cultures that make up the tapestry that is Australian culture. Performing Playback Theatre demands that I continually interrogate my cultural assumptions. I have explored ways of challenging these assumptions through performance and reflection in collaboration with others. Through my explorations of and reflections on my performing practice, I better appreciate the profoundly raw embryonic culture and lore tradition that exists and is building in this nation – Australia. My reflective practice process has enriched me and has given me the impetus to undertake this research. Researching as a *real* participant observer in my own social (practice) world has resulted in a more dynamic interaction between practice and reflection. Hoogland (2003) suggests this increased intensity is due to my practice being "inextricably fused to my scholarship" (p.211). This inextricable fusing has yielded a research experience in which maintaining my practice roles alongside my roles as a researcher has been vital. Reflexivity has required that I interrogate my practice, or perhaps more accurately, it has demanded that I reconsider my practice behaviour, values, and assumptions (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000).

At times, the in-depth scrutiny of my Playback Theatre work has effected my spontaneity and diminished my capacity to appreciate the creative work of others and mine as good enough. I have experienced moments when my sense of play diminished and feelings of disconnection and isolation swamped me as I grappled with the conflicting agendas (and values) of a creative (group) artist and a (solo) scholar. In reading this thesis, you accompany me on my journey and witness my discoveries as I encounter Playback Theatre through the experiences of audience members in the liminal spaces of the research in my local community.

# CHAPTER ONE: Introduction

We have inherited a civilization in which the things that really matter in human life exist at the margin of our culture. What matters? How birthing takes place matters; how infants are raised matters; having a rich and active dream life matters. Animals matter, and so does ontological security and the magic of interpersonal interactions and healthy and passionate sexual expression. Career and prestige and putting a good face on it and the newest fashion in art or science do not matter. Coming to our senses means sorting this out once and for all. It also means becoming embodied. And the two ultimately amount to the same thing.

Morris Berman (1990, p.341-2).

In this critique of contemporary humanity, Berman (1990) proposes that life-giving experiences have been relegated to the margins of dominant culture. In this thesis I investigate a hybrid artform that sits comfortably on the margins because of what it can illuminate there.

The Playback Theatre form offers a contemporary ritual framework from within which individuals can engage with one another at the margins and pursue the magical interactions that Berman claims as life giving. A story-based performance form, Playback Theatre is derivative of the oral tradition merging culturally relevant arts with sacred ritual, personal story and community gatherings. My experiences of performing in and producing Playback Theatre have resulted in some understanding of its potential to build connections between people. I have also come to a growing awareness of the possible gaps and limitations in the method and my practice of it. This study has been derived from this awareness, and seeks to understand Playback Theatre from the experience of participants who dare to engage at the margins though this performance experience.

The study focuses on the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance. This containment of the field of inquiry has facilitated an exploration of this specific public event. Popular for over thirty years, the one-off performance has yet to receive adequate attention in terms of its value and purpose. This study provides some remedy to this situation.

## 1.1 Research Questions

The overarching question guiding this study is:

- What are audience members' experiences of the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performance?

The sub-questions the study seeks to answer are:

- In what ways do the audience members engage and respond during and after the one-off community-based event?
- In what ways does the Playback Theatre form induce these experiences?
- In what ways is Playback Theatre an experience of community for audience members within the specific context?

The purposes of the study are to:

- explore what happens in a Playback Theatre event from the audience members' perspective; and
- attempt ways of describing what Playback Theatre does so that it may be applied with greater integrity.

The research aims to frame the practice of Playback Theatre beyond the often self-referential frames that are a feature of the writing about Playback Theatre. It adds the voices and perceptions of audience members to Playback Theatre scholarship, specifically with relation to the one-off context-based performance. Finally, as an inquiry into audience experience the research process seeks to articulate ways in which people participate in the Playback Theatre ritual; the impact of telling, listening and watching the stories as they unfold; and how the experience equates to an experience of community for participants.

## 1.2 Method

The study seeks to better understand the process of Playback Theatre through the experience of individuals. An exploratory ethnographic approach has been implemented using informant interviews, observation and researcher reflexivity. Early interviews with practitioners and preliminary observational and reflexive data have served to direct the study toward the experiences of audience members. The context for the study is derived from the specific contexts of the performance work enacted by The Brisbane Playback Theatre Company of which I am a member.

## 1.3 Findings

The study findings indicate that audience members come to the one-off community-based Playback Theatre performances for different reasons. Motivation to attend is mostly due to audience members' identification with the context within which the performance is placed, for example, mental health week. Participants also attend because of their familiarity with the form. Audience members engage as participants and spectators. During performances, they actively engage in a personal process of deciding whether to participate and in what way. Simultaneously, they are engaged in experiencing the theatre event and in the appreciation of the performances of the storytellers and the performers. For some, participation extends to include their telling of a personal story. There are numerous reasons why people choose to tell a story during the Playback Theatre performance. People also choose not to tell. Whether the participant chooses to tell or decides against telling, their decision is influenced by their personal values. Many factors conspire to influence whether a person will tell a story or not.

The experience of watching the enactments inspired by the personal stories has been shown to be a key point of audience engagement. Audience members claim to have seen something new, to have been influenced by multiple perspectives, and to have been prompted to reconsider their views of the person telling the story, the people represented in the enactment,

or the ideas presented in the story/enactment. In this way, people have a collective experience in which they interact with people they may otherwise never meet, or come to know.

The study finds that audience members engage in a process of moving in and out of the liminal space of the performance. The nontraditional nature of the form and the highly ritualised structure of the performance activate this experience. The individual undertakes a form of critical reflection and engages in the constant comparison of their actual experience of the event with that which they had expected, and the ongoing consideration of the way in which the form intersects with their values. This results in audience members continually renegotiating their relationship to the values and ideas implicit in the form, particularly that of participation, and the mixing of the personal/public selves. The reflective experience extends beyond the formal performance frame.

The research makes recommendations for purposeful and strategic Playback Theatre work. It proposes that Playback Theatre has a place in contemporary community life because it gives form and structure to that marginal space Berman names in the opening quote, a space where people can meet. The findings in this study provide a framework for the production of viable one-off Playback Theatre events. The study also makes recommendations for practitioner formation and development. Recommendations for further research are listed.

## 1.4 How the Thesis is Organised

The thesis opens with *My Story.* This is designed to situate the reader and tells some of my story. It is written to shed light on how my family history, my life experiences and my love of improvising converge in my practice of Playback Theatre and have led to this research project.

Chapter One – Here, I introduce the thesis and state my research questions. I provide a summary of the research design, articulate the study findings and present an outline of the way the thesis is organised.

Chapter Two – This chapter presents relevant literature on Playback Theatre. Titled *Presenting Playback Theatre,* it introduces the interactive performance form and recounts the historical development of the Playback Theatre movement. The chapter deconstructs the Playback Theatre method through the framework of context, form and content, and establishes it as a form of ritual performance that has application in community-based contexts. The emergence of research and scholarship in Playback Theatre is interrogated. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the thesis extends the knowledge of the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based ritual event.

Chapter Three – The *Review of Literature* chapter documents the fields from the literature that I determine provide useful framing of the study: performance theory, ritual theory, community theory and theory about story and storytelling. Performance theory is presented as the broad context for this thesis. The notion of performance as a rhythmic or systematic process that contains personal and communal expression in a public forum is explored through ritual and ritual performance theory. Here I propose that the liminal activity of ritual performance and the subsequent experience of flow are useful concepts when speaking about audience engagement and audience experience of Playback Theatre. I extend this to include the act of storytelling as a ritual performance. By way of framing the study's focus on community-based activity, I draw on literature exploring relevant concepts of community. Turner's (1969) conception of communitas provides a link back to the previous fields of literature and enables a discussion about experiences of community. Ideas such as diversity, estrangement and The Other are incorporated in the conception of community. The final field in the literature is that of story*.* While the study does not attempt to interrogate the vast potential of story and storytelling in Playback Theatre, this theory provides essential framing for the study with respect to story and storytelling due to the central place of personal story in the Playback Theatre form. This chapter ends with discussion of how these literature fields interact to form the conceptual framework of the thesis.

Chapter Four – Dedicated to the *Methodology* this chapter opens with a consideration of what the researching of performance entails. It describes the multi-method approach I have implemented by illustrating how the ethnographic methods of observation and informant interviews have been combined with researcher reflexivity in the research process. The reader is introduced to the reflexive activity of reflective journaling and to my use of discussions with designated reflective partners. How the elements of researcher subjectivity and trustworthiness of data have been managed in the construction of the thesis is also documented. Finally I describe the process undertaken to collect, analyse and report the data.

Chapter Five – In this chapter I establish the way in which the research site has been manifest in this study. I present the Brisbane Playback Theatre Company and their 2002 Performances. The chapter elaborates on the performances from which the data that is featured in the study have been generated. Chapter Five acts as a bridge to the findings chapters. Predominantly descriptive in nature, its purpose is to locate readers as they embark on reading the study findings.

Chapter Six – This is the first of two chapters reporting the study findings in an inter-textual account of what audience members have revealed about their experiences of the Playback Theatre performance. In *Crossing the Threshold,* Ichart the journey of audience members as they encounter Playback Theatre during the preliminary stages of the performance. I report on how their preparation for and expectations of the event influence their initial engagement. The chapter then examines the various elements confronting audience members as they weigh up the prospect of participating. Audience members' experiences of participating are presented. I write about the experience of reflective distance and report on those things that inhibit participation.

Chapter Seven – In the second of the findings chapters, *"Let's Watch!",* I combine data with my subsequent interpretation to present the audience members' experience of spectating at the Playback Theatre performance. I collate a number of examples to illustrate the experience of connection for audience members as they listen to the personal stories and watch the dramatic enactments. The exhilaration of heightened connection, the disappointment of a missed connection, and the confusion of an unexpected connection is also discussed. The way in which individuals may gain a different perspective on themselves and on others is considered. The chapter ends with discussion about audience participants' experiences of the after-show period.

Chapter Eight – In this concluding chapter I summarise the research findings and present my propositions for purposeful and strategic Playback Theatre practice and the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based event. My recommendations for further research are included. The chapter concludes with the proposition that the application of Playback Theatre as a one-off community-based event represents an experience of community for audience members.
