# ABSTRACT

# 摘要

Contained by a simple accessible ritual structure playback theatre offers a unique audience experience with the possibility of participation. The opportunity to participate introduces a challenge for some. This can be further compounded by the central place of personal storytelling. It is the repeated invitation to tell a story that drives the ritual momentum in the playback theatre performance. Audience members sit with the constant possibility of volunteering, while some are preoccupied with a persistent reluctance to tell.

通过简单易懂的仪式结构，一人一故事剧场为观众提供了一种独特的参与体验。这种参与的机会同样也给一些人带来了挑战。在一人一故事剧场中，我们把个人故事的讲述放在核心地位，这可能会进一步加剧这种挑战。我们会反复邀请不同参与者讲述故事，这推动了一人一故事剧场表演的仪式进程。观众在剧场中始终有自愿参与的可能性，同时也会有些人始终不愿讲述故事。

This 'tension of participation' could be considered the more potent tension underpinning audience members' experiences in the playback theatre event - perhaps more than the dramatic tensions emerging from the performative acts of storytelling and enacting.

相比于观众观看故事讲述和演出时感受到的戏剧张力，这种"参与的紧张感"对于观众而言可能更加强烈。

# INTRODUCTION

# 简介

Playback theatre is a hybrid performance form blending non-traditional theatre and ritual. Significant to defining it as nontraditional are things like the placement in nontraditional theatre venues or locations, the participation of audience members, and the emergent nature of the content[1]. The method is designed as a collective experience and is mediated through a patterned, sequential, theatrical process. It is these key features that render it ritual in form[2]. This article explores the phenomenon of the tension of participation for audience members of playback theatre. It proposes that this tension is contingent on audience members' initial response to the nontraditional nature of playback theatre as a theatre event and the ritual momentum that arises from the way in which it is framed. A strong ritual containment is an essential aspect of fostering and facilitating audience participation during playback theatre. It is this that compels storytelling. The momentum built through the ritualised method, the repeated invitation to tell and the evocation of a heightened theatrical environment can be challenging for audience members and cause them to resist participation. The discussion herein has emerged from my interactions with audience members during a three-year research project[3] in Brisbane, Australia. Excerpts from audience members' stories are interwoven throughout to illustrate the ways in which the tension of participation builds during performance.

一人一故事剧场是一种综合性的表演形式，融合了非传统戏剧和仪式。将其定义为非传统戏剧的重要因素包括：它在非传统剧场或地点演出、观众的参与其中以及内容的涌现性[1]。这种方法被设计成一种集体体验，并通过一种模式化、有序的戏剧过程进行融合。正是这些关键特征使其在形式上具有仪式感[2]。本文探讨了一人一故事剧场观众参与的紧张现象。文章认为，这种紧张感源自于观众对一人一故事剧场作为戏剧活动的非传统性质的初始反应，以及由其框架所产生的仪式能量。在一人一故事剧场中，强烈的仪式感是培养和促进观众参与的一个重要方面。正是这一点激发着人们讲述故事。这些仪式化方法、反复邀请以及高度戏剧化环境所形成的能量，可能对观众构成挑战，并导致他们抵触参与。我在澳大利亚布里斯班开展了一个为期三年的研究项目[3]，在此期间与观众进行了互动，并在此基础上展开了讨论。本文穿插了观众的故事摘录，用以说明在表演过程中参与的紧张感是如何形成的。

# PUBLIC PERFORMANCE: THEATRE OR RITUAL

# 公开演出：戏剧还是仪式

Interactive theatre processes like playback theatre demand the removal of the traditional notion of aesthetic distance and therefore promote an ongoing uncertainty as the fourth wall disintegrates into a blurred threshold for both performer and audience. This is the vitality of such a form. The intersection of personal story with this theatrical uncertainty generates further complexities for participants and introduces additional avenues for the tension of participation. The nontraditional nature of the playback theatre event can shift audience members into a sophisticated process of engagement that demands they undertake a meta-process alongside the fundamental spectating role they are familiar with. For the purposes of this discussion, I will call this process reflective distance. Reflective distance involves a metaphorical move into and out of the real-time aspects of the event as participants weigh up how what they are encountering differs from what they had expected, for example. A similar shift can occur in ritual processes. After van Gennep, Turner[4] proposes that the ritual event proceeds in three phases[5]: separation; transition; and incorporation or re-entry. The separation or pre-liminal phase involves participants leaving behind of the real-time and real-space dimensions of their daily lives. It enables them to shift to a more "sacred space and time from profane or secular space and time"[6]. This phase coincides to the pre-show period at playback theatre and can begin days or weeks before as the purpose and context of the performance are established and the gateway by which participants will enter is initiated. The shift to separation opens a performance arena that exists in-between rather than set-apart from ordinary life, a space on the "border, a margin, a site of negotiation"[7]. Within this, participants encounter the second phase, the liminal or *transition* phase[8]. The liminal phase induces the potential for anti-structure and ambiguities, a space where past and future can merge. Interestingly, Cabral constructs this in-between time and space as a bridge into "situations that would be tense in the real context"[9]. Crossing this bridge, the threshold into a social context that has the potential to disturb the social status quo, and contravene the protocols of political correctness, presents a challenge for many audience members. Such a shift is compelled by the potency of ritualised time and space. It is this shift between the separation and liminal stages that are a key site for the tension of participation and can trigger shifts into reflective distance. The third stage, *incorporation,* coincides with the post-show period of the playback theatre event[10].

交互式戏剧（如一人一故事剧场）要求摒弃传统的审美距离概念，因此，当第四堵墙瓦解，演员和观众的界限模糊时，会产生一种持续的不确定性。这正是这类戏剧形式的生命力所在。个人故事与这种戏剧的不确定性交织在一起，为参与者带来了更多的复杂性，并增加了参与者紧张感的来源。一人一故事剧场活动的非传统性质会将观众带入一个复杂的参与过程，要求他们在熟悉的观看者角色之外，进入一种元过程。在本文讨论中，我将把这一过程称为"反思距离"。反思距离是指参与者发现所遇到的与他们所预期的有什么不同时，在权衡中，在隐喻意义上进入和退出事件的过程。仪式过程中也会发生类似的转变。继范-根尼普之后，特纳[4]提出仪式活动分为三个阶段[5]：分离、过渡、融合或重新进入。在分离或前临界阶段，参与者要离开日常生活中的实时和实地维度。这使他们能够从"世俗时空转变到神圣时空"。这一阶段与一人一故事剧场的演出前阶段相吻合，可能在演出几天或几周前开始，因为演出的目的和背景已经确定，参与者进入的通道也已启动。向"分离"的转变开启了一个介于两者之间而非脱离普通生活的表演空间，一个位于 "边界、边缘、交涉之地"[7]的空间。在这一阶段，参与者会遇到第二个阶段，即临界或*过渡*阶段[8]。临界阶段具有反结构和模糊性的潜在趋势，是过去与未来融合的空间。有趣的是，卡布拉尔将这种介于时间和空间之间的状态视为通往"真实环境中会紧张的状态"的桥梁[9]。穿过这座桥梁，进入一个有可能扰乱社会现状、违背政治正确规程的社会环境，对许多观众来说是一个挑战。仪式化的时空所内含的能量驱使着这种转变发生。正是这种在分离和临界阶段之间的转变，是参与者紧张感来源的关键所在，这种转变也制造了反思距离。第三个阶段是*融合*，与一人一故事剧场活动的演出后阶段相吻合[10]。

[4] Turner (see 1969, 1986, 1990) has been a seminal thinker in bringing ritual theory to bear in contemporary western performance theory. While very much predicated on the notion of performance as a culturally conservative activity in tribal and agrarian societies it is useful when discussing public ritual.

[4] 特纳（见 1969 年、1986 年、1990 年）是将仪式理论引入当代西方表演理论的开创性思想家。虽然在很大程度上，表演是部落和农业社会的一种文化保守活动，但这一概念在讨论公共仪式时非常有用。

[5] These stages are derived from van Gennep. The van Gennep schema derives from the idea that performance occurs in the context of everyday life, in in-between spaces, rather than the idea implicit in the frameworks of Singer, Hymes, Bauman and Barba that performance is "set apart" (Carlson, 1996, p.20).

[5] 这些阶段源自凡-根尼普。凡-根尼普模式源于这样一种观点，即表演发生在日常生活的背景中，发生在夹缝空间中，而不是辛格、海姆斯、鲍曼和巴尔巴的框架中所隐含的观点，即表演是"独立的"（Carlson, 1996, p.20）。

[8] Van Gennep 将此称为 "margin "或 "limen"（拉丁语，意为门槛）。

[10] Here participants begin to integrate their experiences, making sense of what they have seen, heard, felt, and remembered. Reflective integration can continue well after the show as people resume their everyday social roles becoming aware of the new perspectives they may have from the experience.

[10] 在这里，参与者开始整合他们的经验，对他们的所见、所闻、所感和所忆进行梳理。演出结束后，当人们重新回归日常的社会角色，意识到他们可能从这次经历中获得了新的视角时，反射性整合可能会持续很长时间。

# SHOCKS AND SURPRISES – ARRIVING, READY OR NOT!

# 冲击和惊喜--无论是否准备就绪，都将到来！

Initial perceptions of the playback theatre event can be surprising for audience members as they come to some realisation that separation is imminent. An audience member's expectations and initial perceptions of the playback theatre performance might need to be met or transformed in order for them to effect separation and be freed to enter into the spirit of the performance. When Darren arrives at a playback theatre event by himself he looks around in the hope of meeting a friend there. He is a performer himself and has been at a Company performance some years back. As he takes in the surrounds he is more than surprised by what he observes. This is how he describes it:

当观众意识到分离的临近时，他们对一人一故事剧场活动的最初看法可能会令人惊讶。观众对一人一故事剧场演出的期望和最初感知可能需要得到满足或改变，这样他们才能实现分离，自由地进入演出的精神世界。当达伦独自来到一人一故事剧场时，他环顾四周，希望能在那里遇到一位朋友。他自己也是一名演员，几年前曾参加过剧团的演出。当他仔细观察周围环境时，他的观察结果令他大吃一惊。他是这样描述的：

> I was expecting a different venue. Some place more neutral. [When] I came in and realised that it was a community … I felt really apart from that, and that worked against me feeling at home because a lot of people seemed to know each other and I didn't know anyone. I found myself doing some social-environmental (analysis), who are these people? I felt quite outside. And I was expecting to see [a friend] there, and she wasn’t … The thing that struck me was that, there were three women on stage, or four women on stage, and two of them were older women, and I was quite surprised by that (Darren[11], independent street performer).

> 我以为会是一个不同的场地。一个更中立的地方。[当]我来到这里，意识到这是一个社群……我觉得自己真的与社群格格不入，这让我没有家的感觉，因为很多人似乎都互相认识，而我却谁也不认识。我发现自己在做一些社会环境（分析），这些人是谁？我觉得自己置身事外。我还以为会看到[一个朋友]在那里，但她不在……让我印象深刻的是，舞台上有三名或四名女性，其中两名是年长的女性，这让我感到非常惊讶（达伦[11]，独立街头艺人）。

Darren's experience reveals significant tension due to unexpected elements about the venue, the company and the audience composition.

达伦的经历中，演出地点、演出团队和观众构成等意想不到的因素造成了一种强烈的紧张感。

These perceptions of the place of the performance, the history of the Company, and his socially formed cultural values and personal ideas all converge and threaten to overwhelm him. At a certain level, the mounting tension he feels stimulates a shift to reflective distance. While this serves to dispel the tension of participation somewhat it impedes Darren's separation and minimises his capacity to participate further until he finds a moment of re-entry.

这些对表演地点、剧团历史、他在社会中形成的文化价值观和个人观念的看法交织在一起，有可能压垮他。在某种程度上，他所感受到的日益加剧的紧张感刺激了他向反思距离的转移。虽然这在某种程度上有助于消除参与者的紧张感，但却阻碍了达伦的分离，并进一步将他的参与性降至最低，直到他找到重新进入的时机。

[11] Darren is a fictionalised name; while all interview participants have given permission for their testimony t be included, their names have been anonymised.

[11] 达伦是一个虚构的名字；虽然所有采访参与者都同意将他们的证词包括在内，但他们的名字都已匿名。

Being surprised by elements of a theatre event is not uncommon. The participatory nature of playback theatre can up the ante with regard to how a participant manages such surprises. In stark contrast to Darren some find surprises stimulating and delightful and respond to the tension of participation by anticipating greater involvement. Far from overwhelming the participant, the quality of this tension is appealing and comes when an encounter with the unexpected engenders intrigue. Craig arrives at the same event Darren describes above. His first impressions follow:

对戏剧活动中的元素感到惊讶并不罕见。一人一故事剧场的参与性质可以提高参与者处理这些惊喜的能力。与达伦形成鲜明对比的是，有些人认为惊喜令人兴奋和愉悦，并通过期待更多的参与来应对参与的紧张感。这种紧张感不仅不会让参与者不知所措，反而会在遇到意想不到的事情时产生耐人寻味的吸引力。克雷格参加了达伦在上面描述的活动。他的第一印象如下：

> There was a wonderful sense of community. There were people walking up, shaking hands, and introducing themselves. People felt very comfortable to do this. It wasn’t contrived and it wasn’t forced. … There was individuals, groups, couples … It reminded me of an old town public meeting, ‘let’s gather’ let's we - the community - gather, and let’s talk about what’s on. … There was a sense of event, but not in a traditional (theatre) sense. It even has its own rituals. It’s not like we’re going to see play [at] ‘the theatre’ [yet] there is a set of rituals that take place. … [W]hen the performance began, there was immediate silence when the actors entered (Craig, High School Drama Teacher).

> 有一种奇妙的集体感。人们走过来，握手，自我介绍。人们觉得这样做很舒服。没有刻意，也没有强迫。……有个体、群体、情侣……这让我想起了老镇的公共会议，"让我们聚一聚"，让我们——这个社群——聚在一起，让我们谈谈正在发生的事情。……有一种参加活动的感觉，但不是传统意义上的（戏剧）。它甚至有自己的仪式。我们不是去'剧院'看戏，[但]有一套仪式要进行。……演出开始时，演员一进场，现场立即鸦雀无声（克雷格，高中戏剧教师）。

Craig appears ready for whatever comes next. His response is more in line with what Coppieters[12] predicts of audience members at the non-traditional theatre event, who suggests that they are likely to be interested and playful and take more of a risk. This risking takes the form of becoming "a tangible active creator of the theatrical event[13]". They embrace their pivotal role in what happens next and trust that this role is guided by the way the ritualised framing of the process points to specific gaps in the action that invite genuine participation.

克雷格似乎已经为接下来的一切做好了准备。他的反应更符合 Coppieters[12] 对非传统戏剧活动中观众的预测，他认为观众可能会对戏剧感兴趣，会玩耍，会冒更大的风险。这种冒险的形式是成为"戏剧活动中真实积极创造者[13]"。他们接受自己在接下来发生的事情中扮演的关键角色，并相信这种角色是由过程的仪式化框架所引导的，它指出了行动中存在特定空隙，从而邀请真正的参与。

[12] Bennett (1990)

It is likely that most audience members have experienced a degree of separation by the time the players take the stage in a playback theatre event. There can be further jolts at this stage as the central place of personal story is highlighted, and again, when this personal dimension is juxtaposed with the revelation that participant's are to join players on stage in a public performance as a storyteller. These transitions are likely sites for the tension of participation and can serve to further inhibit the full separation of audience members. Unlike Darren and Craig, Eloise draws little conclusion from initial perceptions of the venue and audience. She arrives at the performance with friends who are familiar with playback theatre and feel well hosted. It is in witnessing the actions of the first few storytellers that she begins to feel uneasy. She shares her experience:

在一人一故事剧场活动中，当演员登台表演时，大多数观众可能已经经历了一定程度的分离。在这一阶段，当个人故事的中心地位被强调时，当强调个人这一维度、提出参与者要在公开表演中作为故事讲述者上台与演员一起时，这可能会产生进一步的震惊。这些过渡很可能是参与者紧张感的来源，也会进一步抑制观众们的完全分离。与达伦和克雷格不同，埃洛伊丝几乎没有从初始的对演出地点和观众的感知中得出结论。她和熟悉一人一故事剧场的朋友们一起来到演出现场，感觉受到了很好的款待。在目睹前几位讲述者的行为时，她开始感到不安。她分享了自己的经历：

> I wasn't used to that kind of theatre. I found it quite confronting that this was on an emotional level … I was watching, looking back to see whose story it was, seeing if they were reacting in the right way, the traditional way, and that was good. I was trying to understand what was going on. I got more involved, got more carried away, with some of the longer stories at the end (Eloise, young woman new to playback).

> 我不习惯这种戏剧。我发现这在情感层面上相当具有对抗性……我一直在看，回过头来看这是谁的故事，看他们是否以正确的方式、传统的方式做出反应。这很好。我试图了解发生了什么。最后一些较长的故事让我更投入，更沉浸（埃洛伊丝，一人一故事的新观众）。

The tension she is feeling about the way in which the playback theatre moment contravenes her values shifts Eloise to reflective distance. She needs to gather information about the unfamiliar form and is able to observe the process and assess the consequences of participation on others. After stepping back, Eloise is able to surrender or renegotiate her expectations of the theatre event and her idea about what constitutes performance or public gatherings and move toward being more involved.

当一人一故事剧场与她的价值观相悖时，她所感受到的紧张感使埃洛伊丝产生了反思距离。她需要收集有关这种陌生形式的信息，并能够观察过程和评估参与它对人们的影响。在退后一些距离之后，埃洛伊丝能够放弃或重新调整她对戏剧活动的期望，以及她对演出或公众集会的看法，并转向更多的参与。

Eloise uses her moment of retreat to reflective distance to integrate unexpected emotions she is experiencing. She states that at some point she is carried away signaling her growing ease with the experience, a growing recognition of the ritual pattern, and a move toward the liminal.

埃洛伊丝在她的后退过程中，以反思距离来整合她所经历的意想不到的情绪。她说，在某一时刻，她沉浸其中了，这表明她越来越容易接受这种体验，越来越认识到仪式的模式，并开始走向临界。

Earlier, Craig names what he sees as a "set of rituals" at play in the opening sequence of the playback theatre event. He appears very comfortable with the way in which this start might diverge from a traditional theatre event. Fox (1999) summarised the ritual dimension of playback theatre highlighting five specific elements: keeping to rules, ecstatic emotion, transpersonal dimension, goal of transformation, spellbinding language. It is the fundamental simplicity of the first element that could be responsible for creating the conditions for the other four. The repetitive nature of the form gradually reveals the rules of the frame. It is not that there are rules as such, but that the implicit rules are made known in some way. In observing the patterns in the form, Eloise has become freer to enter the ritualised frame. This does not automatically translate into a desire to participate more publicly, however.

早些时候，克雷格把一人一故事剧场开场流程中他看到的部分称为“一套仪式”。他似乎对这种开场可能与传统戏剧活动不同而感到非常满意。福克斯（Fox，1999 年）总结了一人一故事剧场的仪式的维度，强调了五个具体要素：遵守规则、沉醉的情绪、超脱个人维度、转变的目标、迷人的语言。正是第一个要素的基本简单性为其他四个要素创造了条件。形式的重复性逐渐揭示了框架的规则。这并不是说存在规则本身，而是隐含的规则以某种方式被揭示出来。通过观察形式中的模式，艾露伊丝可以更自由地进入仪式化的框架。然而，这并没有自动转化为更公开的参与意愿。

# LIMINAL MOMENTS – ENGAING WITH UNCERTAINTY

# 临界时刻--与不确定性为伴

As the performance progresses, the personal stories that are told are animated on-the-spot. As the players improvise, the audience members are exposed to the possibilities of participation as they observe the actors giving full expression to the characters and explore the emotional texture of the tellers' experiences. There is time to watch the immediate impact on participants of telling and of watching the subsequent enactment, as Eloise does. As familiarity builds comfort with the form grows. Establishing a ritual frame serves to announce that a certain set of rules are at play and *releases* participants to act beyond their constrained domestic roles and engage in other ways with themselves, with each other, and with the social environment[14]. The potential of this released state equates to the liminal or transitional moment and frees participants to dare and to risk as they move toward an experience of flow[15]. However, the tendency for audience members to respond to the tension of participation by shifting to reflective distance continues.

随着表演的进行，讲述者们的个人故事也在现场变得生动起来。随着演员们的即兴表演，观众们在观察演员们对角色的充分表达和探索讲述者经历的情感质地的过程中，感受到了参与的可能性。观众有时间观察讲述过程并观看紧随其后的演绎对参与者的直接影响，就像艾露伊丝所做的那样。随着熟悉程度的增加，对这种形式的舒适感也会随之增加。建立仪式框架的作用在于宣布一套特定的规则正在发挥作用，并*释放*参与者的行为，使其超越受限的家庭角色，以其他方式与自己、与他人以及与社会环境互动[14]。这种释放状态的潜能等同于临界或过渡时刻，使参与者敢于冒险，走向流动体验[15]。然而，观众面向参与的紧张感时，仍然倾向于转向到反思距离中。

[14] Turner (1982) and Schechner (1985).

[15] Flow provides another way in which to speak of the liminal experience.Csikszentmihalyi (1990, 1992, 1997) writes of activities where we experience *flow.* He shows that the degree of difficulty of a sporting event must not exceed the level at which it becomes unachievable (too hard) for the individual. He proposes that we desire to feel stretched to the limit and yet simultaneously feel as though we are somehow "master of our own fate".

[15] 克西森特米哈伊（Csikszentmihalyi，1990 年、1992 年、1997 年）写道，在一些活动中，我们会体验到"心流"。他提出，我们渴望感觉自己的能力达到了极限，但同时又感觉自己在某种程度上"主宰着自己的命运"。

In many ways, the move into and out of flow (and into and out of reflective distance) constitutes the occurrence of micro ritual-phase cycles: separation-transition-integration where the micro integration phase coincides with the next separation phase. The way in which Clare speaks about her first experience of playback theatre reveals a number of micro cycles as she prepares to enter more fully into the spirit of the event. She admits:

在许多方面，进入和退出流动（以及进入和退出反思距离）构成了微观仪式阶段的循环：分离-过渡-整合，其中微观整合阶段与下一个分离阶段相吻合。克莱尔谈到她第一次体验一人一故事剧场的经历，揭示了她准备更充分地进入这个活动的精神层面时的一系列微观循环。她承认：

> At first we didn't know what to expect. We watched and tried to catch on. I really started to get into the last part of it. The beginning was confusing. We didn't know what to expect or what to think. We had to wait and see. We started getting into it more toward the end … After a while, when I realised that I wasn't going to have to speak, or be made to, and that I could watch other people's stories I was OK. But for quite a while I was worried I would be picked out (Clare, first-time playback theatre go-er).

> 起初，我们不知道该期待什么。我们一边看，一边试着跟上节奏。到了最后一部分，我才真正入戏。一开始很混乱。我们不知道该期待什么，该想什么。我们只能静观其变。到了最后，我们开始慢慢进入状态……过了一段时间，当我意识到我不需要发言，也不需要别人强迫我发言，我可以观看其他人的故事时，我就放下了。但有一段时间，我担心自己会被挑出来（克莱尔，第一次来到一人一故事剧场）。

Clare's comment suggests that she is feeling anxious about what is required of her and is not particularly confident that she is up to the challenge. Tension of participation is linked participant anxiety. Clare's concern is compounded by the realisation during one of her integrative moments, that her story includes her husband. The idea of revealing intimate details and possibly embarrassing her husband is a values-conflict for her. This provides another surge of anxiety and further tension around whether she will consent/choose to tell her story. Clare's admits to feeling resistant to participating due to her anxiety about exposing her husband. Self-regulation such as this occurs frequently during the playback theatre performance and impedes experiences of flow for individuals. Spectators are known to shift to reflective distance to release a growing tension of participation and engage in inner dialogues with themselves as they develop reasons not to tell, for example, that others are more interesting, or that others have a greater need. These shifts represent micro-integrative moments that move a participant to a place of re-separation and subsequently enable re-entry. Schechner[16] states that "in all kinds of performances a certain definite threshold is crossed at which time participants attain a state of flow." Flow coincides with those times when participants feel some resolution with respect to values conflict or risk challenges arising during the performance. This is most often with respect to whether to participate as a storyteller yet could also be connected to the experience that Clare alludes to of reaching a new level of understanding about the rules of engagement and the collective culture of the audience; information that emerges as the performance proceeds.

克莱尔的评论表明，她对要求她做的事情感到焦虑，并且对自己是否能应对挑战没有特别的信心。参与的紧张与参与者的焦虑有关。克蕾尔在一次整合过程中意识到她的故事中包括她的丈夫，这加剧了她的担忧。对她来说，披露私密细节并可能使她的丈夫难堪，这与她价值观有冲突。这让加剧了她的紧张、焦虑，她犹豫是否要同意/选择讲述自己的故事。克莱尔承认，出于对暴露丈夫的焦虑，她对参与感到抗拒。像这样的自我约束在一人一故事剧场表演中经常出现，阻碍了个人的心流体验。我们知道，当观众的紧张感增加时，为了消解紧张，观众会产生反思距离，并与自己进行内心对话，寻找不说故事的理由，例如，其他人的故事更有趣，或者其他人有更强的讲故事的需求。这些转变代表了微观的整合时刻，使参与者进入重新分离的状态，并随后能够重新进入。Schechner[16]指出："在所有类型的表演中，都会有一个特定的临界点，在这个临界点上，参与者会达到一种心流的状态。"当参与者对表演过程中出现的价值观冲突或风险挑战感到某种程度的解决时，就会出现心流状态。这通常与是否参与讲故事有关，但也可能与克莱尔所提到的体验有关，即对参与的规则和观众集体文化的理解达到了一个新的水平；这些信息随着表演的进行而涌现。

# RESISTING THE LURE OF THE LIMINAL

# 抵制边缘的诱惑

Ritualising time and space brings with it an inherent counterpoint to the expected social structure of a public event. Even mild resistance to the ambiguities inherent in the "anti-structure" evoked by the ritual frame stimulates tension of participation. Despite this the ritual momentum builds and the lure of the liminal can feel like a loss of autonomy or an interruption of personal agency and can lead to an experience of terror for some. If the liminal pull accelerates in such a way that a participant becomes frightened or confused they will do more than shift to reflective distance, they will resist the desire to participate at all costs. Let us return to Darren who is still recovering from the disappointment he felt about the venue, the audience and the players on arrival. He has found a seat in the third row near the aisle. This positioning enables him to continue his observation of the audience as they arrive, and gives him an excellent view of the stage area. As the show gets underway he maintains his observational stance. He is determined to overcome his earlier disappointment and discomfort yet he is immediately besieged by a totally unexpected story:

时间和空间仪式化过程与公共活动中预期的社会结构有着内在的对立。即使是对仪式框架所唤起的"反结构"内在模糊性的轻微抵制，也会激发参与的紧张感。尽管如此，仪式的势头仍在增长，边缘的诱惑会让人产生失去了自主性或个人能动性被打断的感觉，并可能导致一些人的恐怖体验。如果边缘拉力的加速让参与者感到恐惧或困惑，他们所做的就不仅仅是转向反思距离，而是会不惜一切代价抵制参与的欲望。让我们回到达伦身上，他仍未从抵达时对场地、观众和选手的失望中恢复过来。他在第三排靠近过道的位置找到了一个座位。这个位置使他能够在观众到达时继续观察观众，并能很好地看到舞台区域。演出开始后，他继续保持观察的姿态。他决心克服之前的失望和不适，但他立刻被一个完全出乎意料的故事所困扰：

> I entered with the idea that I didn't have any experiences that related to the theme. Then had a whole lot of things go 'Bop! Bop! Bop!' (a sound representing each story). That really struck me about the night, we were telling stories like when a bunch of people sits around a table. It was a dynamic process. … I had a bunch of things come up - personal stories - and I didn’t really know there were issues there (Darren, independent street performer).

> 我一开始以为自己没有任何与主题相关的经历。然后有一大堆事情'嘭！嘭！嘭！'（每个声音代表一个故事）。当晚的情况让我印象深刻，我们就像一群人围坐在桌边讲故事一样。这是一个充满活力的过程。……我想到了很多事情——个人故事——我真的不知道这里面有问题（达伦，独立街头艺人）。

He is highly resistant to telling his personal story in this public place to this gathered public audience. Darren's resistance is more complex than Clare's and in turn leads to a greater generation of the tension of participation as he battles the persistent story. As the performance proceeds he is constantly distracted by the inner tension he experiences yet continues to resists telling his story. He admits that he does not feel that he can relax and surrender to the ritual moment. He spends the performance vacillating between the persistent urge to participate and share his story, and his reflective reasoning that it is not the time or place for him to tell. This decision not to tell has demanded his full attention as he has been gripped by the tension of participation, teetering on the verge of the ritual threshold. Darren's reluctance to tell could be interpreted by considering a number of impediments to his capacity to release. Firstly, he admits that he does not feel he can succeed in participating in a way that does not contravene his values. He feels he will be over-exposed as he endeavours to construct a story that he feels is poorly formed and is breaking out in such an unexpected and discomforting way. As he resists, his confusion grows and he feels further excluded. It is only after the event that Darren can appreciate how determined he was not to yield. He is left feeling disappointed and isolated until he is able to chat with other audience members during the after-show period and integrate the experience.

他非常抗拒在这个公共场合向聚集在一起的公众讲述他的个人故事。与克莱尔相比，达伦的抵触情绪更为复杂，这也导致他在与持续不断的故事作斗争时，产生了更大的参与紧张感。随着表演的进行，他不断被内心的紧张感所干扰，但仍继续抗拒讲述自己的故事。他承认，他不觉得自己能够放松下来，臣服于仪式的时刻。整场表演中，他一直在参与和分享自己故事的强烈冲动与他认为现在不是讲述故事的时间和地点的反射性理由之间徘徊。当他被参与的紧张感紧紧抓住，徘徊在仪式门槛的边缘时，不讲述的决定要求他全神贯注。达伦不愿意告诉别人的原因可以通过考虑他释放能力的一些障碍来解释。首先，他承认自己无法以不违背自己价值观的方式成功参与。他觉得自己会过度暴露自己，因为他在努力构建一个他认为并不完整的故事，而且这个故事是以如此出人意料和令人不适的方式爆发出来的。随着他的抵制，他的困惑在增长，并进一步感到自己被排斥在外。只有在活动之后，达伦才能体会到自己是多么坚决地不屈服。他感到失望和孤立，直到在演出结束后与其他观众聊天时，他才得以整合这种经历。

It is not clear what might have happened had Darren succumbed to the persistent story. One possibility is that he would have relaxed. When Helen attempts to resist the story that bubbles up about ten minutes into the performance, she too is continually distracted by it. She recounts her experience:

目前还不清楚，如果达伦屈服于这个顽固的故事，可能会发生什么。一种可能是他会放松下来。当海伦试图抵制演出开始十分钟左右涌现的故事时，她也不断被故事所干扰。她讲述了自己的经历：

> I thought 'oh it'll go away' [laugh] but then it was too insistent, I could feel it, I can't remember how, but I was connecting with other responses. I thought 'I *have* to say something.' … I couldn't hold it anymore (Helen, regular playback theatre-goer).

> 我想'哦，它会消失的'[笑]，但后来它太执着了，我能感觉到它，我不记得是怎么感觉到的，但我和其他反应联系在一起。我想'我*得*说点什么'。……我再也坚持不下去了（海伦，经常来一人一故事剧场的观众）。

Unlike Darren she eventually succumbs and shares her story in the public arena. She consents to the ritual momentum compelling her and the tension she is harboring dissipates. Helen is able to relax into another level of flow in the performance and enjoy the chance to listen to others. The shift in attention that occurs when a volunteer teller comes to the stage can dispel tension in participants who have chosen not to tell. Tension of participation appears to be a uniquely individual experience and is transformed when the individual shifts attention from him/herself to another and engages more intimately in the collective experience of the ritual event. It is during these experiences of flow, of unselfconscious engagement, and collective listening that the tension of participation can be released.

与达伦不同，她最终屈服了，在公共场合分享了自己的故事。她同意仪式的力量迫使她这样做，她的紧张情绪也随之消散。海伦能够在表演中放松到另一个层次，享受倾听他人的机会。当自愿分享的讲述者上台时，注意力的转移可以消除选择不讲述的参与者的紧张情绪。参与的紧张感似乎是一种独特的个人体验，当个人将注意力从自身转移到他人身上，并更亲密地参与到仪式活动的集体体验中时，紧张感就会发生转变。正是在这些心流的、无意识参与和集体倾听的体验中，参与的紧张感才得以释放。

# FLOW – THE MOMENTUM OF THE RITUAL

# 心流——仪式的动力

An experience of flow occurs when our "body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile[17]". It equates to attaining a sense of mastery over something that presents a challenge. The reframing this "sense of mastery" to "a sense of participation" is perhaps more meaningful in the context of the playback theatre ritual. Within the magic of ritual anxiety can quickly move to arousal. Between flow and anxiety, arousal occurs where the participant's skills may not be immediately sufficient but there is scope for them to engage in the challenge. The following excerpt from Hillary's story demonstrates one teller's experience of moving beyond resistance and concern about what others think and surrendering to the growing momentum that delivers her to the stage. She says:

[17] p.3 Csikszentmihalyi, (1997)

当我们的"身体或心灵在自愿的努力下达到极限，以完成一件困难而有价值的事情[17]"时，就会产生心流体验。它等同于对挑战性事物的驾驭感。将这种"驾驭感"重塑为"参与感"，在一人一故事剧场仪式中或许更有意义。在魔法般的仪式中，焦虑会迅速转变为一种唤醒。当参与者的技能可能无法立即满足要求，但他们仍有参与挑战的余地时，"唤醒"会在心流与焦虑之间的地带出现。下面这段希拉里的故事节选展示了一位讲述者的经历，她超越了抵触情绪和对他人看法的担忧，屈服于将她带到舞台上的不断增长的动力。她说：

> I was thinking 'how can you possibly reflect this story that I have so heartfelt, inside my belly that makes me feel the way I do, and express it, like that, in all these little stories.' [At that moment] I was thinking 'they can do this (the little stories), can they do that (my heartfelt-inside-my-belly-story)?' In a way, those first few stories were weaving the test of you. [As I watched] I thought, 'OK, they got part of it right, pretty well - and I had doubted you would get it right - [it was] close enough.

> 我当时在想，'你怎么可能把我内心深处的这个故事反映出来，让我有这样的感受，并把它表达出来，就像这样，用所有这些小故事来表达。'[那一刻]我在想'他们能做到这一点（小故事），他们能做到那一点（我心中发自内心的故事）吗？从某种程度上说，最初的几个故事就是对你的考验。[当我观看时]我想，'好吧，他们说对了一部分，相当不错——我曾对此有怀疑——[这已经]足够接近了。

> You were touching everything. That was great. … I thought, 'It's going well. Now, what's going to happen next?

> 你触及了一切。太棒了。……我想，'进展顺利。接下来会发生什么？

> You had that space for people to decide whether or not they wanted their story to be out there. I had heavy legs, and inside was about the burst, whether I was going to run away or run up to you [laughs]. It was a pretty shaky moment. But once I got up, I could feel the strength of others, and I thought, 'Go for it Hillary!' (Hillary, community worker).

> 你为人们提供了空间，让他们决定是否要把自己的故事公之于众。我的腿很沉，我的内心在迸发，我是要跑开还是跑向你[笑]。那一刻我的心很乱。但一旦我站起来，我就能感受到他人的力量，我想，'希拉里，加油！'（希拉里，社区工作者）。

When Hillary becomes aware of her desire to tell she is a little overwhelmed. Yet she launches herself across the threshold harnessing all the tension that is arising from the interaction of her urgent story with her reflective assessment of the likely risks. As she gathers herself she moves toward flow and becomes, in Csikszentmihalyi's (1992) words, "master" of her own "fate" (p.3). Hillary is besieged by her compelling need to tell. She makes a different choice to that of Darren. Her story as an example of those audience members who yield fully to the ritual pull taking great risks and delivering the performance more fully into the hands of the audience. This notion of personal (and collective) agency is embedded in the participatory opportunities in the ritual process where the involvement of the individual cannot be cannot be forced only invited or sought[18]. The way in which playback theatre draws on personal stories and theatrical form within a ritual performance process expands the potential for engagement in the public event and encourages individual and group agency and responsibility. This renders the tension of participation a potential desirable element for maximising the performance energy and the audience experience.

[18] p.246 Myerhoff (1990).

当希拉里意识到自己有诉说的欲望时，她有点不知所措。然而，她利用自己迫切的故事与对可能风险的反射性评估之间的相互作用所产生的所有紧张，跨过了门槛。当她收拾好自己的心情时，她就接近了心流，用 Csikszentmihalyi（1992 年）的话说，她成了自己"命运"的"主人"（第 3 页）。希拉里被她迫切的讲述需求所包围。她做出了与达伦不同的选择。她的故事为那些完全屈服于仪式的观众树立了榜样，他们冒着巨大的风险，将表演更充分地交到观众手中。这种个人（和集体）能动性的概念蕴含在仪式过程的参与机会中，个人的参与不能被强迫，只能被邀请或寻求[18]。一人一故事剧场在仪式表演过程中借鉴个人故事和戏剧形式的方式扩大了参与公共活动的可能性，并鼓励个人和团体的能动性和责任感。这使得参与的张力成为潜在的理想元素，从而最大限度地提升表演能量和观众体验。

# TENSION OF PARTICIPATION – MAKING IT WORK

# 参与的张力--使其发挥作用

The stories shared here suggest that through the ritualised structure of the playback theatre form, participants seem empowered or challenged, or stimulated to be involved. Unlike some traditional ritual performances, the liminal opportunity afforded through the ritualised structure of the playback theatre performance does not necessarily induce deep trance states for audience members. Audience experiences are predicated on the way in which they negotiate the initial unfamiliarity of the form and the uncertainty of the separation and liminal phases of the ritual. This is helped or hindered by individuals' responses to the invitation to tell a personal story in the context of a public performance. Sitting with the constant possibility of volunteering to participate can be a preoccupation. Participants can become occupied by their repeated preparation to tell a story and for some, feel compelled to participate. Others experience a persistent reluctance to tell. The dynamic of reflective distance appears to enhance the engagement of the audience and provide and outlet for the tension of participation. The question remains as to whether the dissipation of the tension of participation through the move to reflective distance hinders the possibilities for the performance (and audience).

这里分享的故事表明，通过一人一故事剧场形式的仪式化结构，参与者似乎获得了力量，或受到了挑战，或激发了参与的热情。与某些传统仪式表演不同，一人一故事剧场表演的仪式化结构所提供的临界机会并不一定会诱发观众的深度恍惚状态。观众的体验取决于他们对仪式形式最初的陌生感以及仪式中分离和临界阶段的不确定性进行协商的方式。观众个人对在公开表演中讲述个人故事的邀请的反应，会帮助或阻碍这种体验。坐等自愿参与的可能性始终存在，这可能会成为一种心理干扰。参与者可能会因为反复准备讲述故事而变得心烦意乱，对某些人来说，他们会感到不得不参与。其他人则始终不愿讲述。反思距离的动态似乎增强了听众的参与度，并为参与的紧张情绪提供了出口。但问题是，转向反思距离是否会消解参与的张力，从而阻碍表演（和观众）的可能性。

This article has explored the tension of participation confronting audience members as they contend with the ritual momentum of playback theatre. It has focused on storytelling as the primary avenue for participation. In performances where the tension of participation is the more potent tension underpinning audience members' experiences conductors and ensembles need to work with a greater sensibility to enable individuals to negotiate the shift to the liminal experience. To ensure that the liminal phase of the playback theatre performance is characterised by moments of unselfconsciousness, high spontaneity and experiences of flow certain elements in the form have to converge to enable participants to join in. This usually means that the challenge present in the task of participating is not too difficult for the individual.

本文探讨了观众在面对一人一故事剧场的仪式感时所面临的参与紧张感。文章将重点放在作为主要参与途径的讲故事上。在演出中，参与的紧张感是支撑观众体验的更强大的张力，领航员和剧团需要以更高的敏感度来工作，使观众们能够克服向临界体验的转变。为了确保一人一故事剧场表演的临界阶段具有无意识、高度自发性和心流体验的特点，这种形式中的某些元素必须汇聚在一起，使参与者能够参与其中。这通常意味着，参与任务中的挑战对个人来说并不难。

The improvised nature of the performance can represent too great a challenge for some audience members and lead to anxiety or confusion. Any factor that induces fear, uncertainty or anxiety acts to inhibit flow for the audience. Other barriers to participation arise from a lack of familiarity with the rules of engagement, concerns about of exposing self of another, concerns about being judged, boredom, disappointment, and feelings of alienation. Similarly, concern about others' safety, dissatisfaction with the quality of the artistry, and discomfort arising from emotional responses could limit an individual's capacity to surrender. It is the responsibility of the conductor and the ensemble to work to maximise the conditions required for greatest participation by the greatest number over the course of the performance. Inability to overcome barriers to participation could result in individuals excluding themselves from the activity altogether.

表演的即兴性质可能对某些观众构成太大的挑战，从而导致焦虑或困惑。任何引起恐惧、不确定性或焦虑的因素都会抑制观众的参与热情。其他阻碍参与的因素包括不熟悉参与规则、担心暴露自己、担心被评判、无聊、失望和疏远感。同样，对他人安全的担忧、对艺术质量的不满以及情绪反应引起的不适也会限制观众交出自身的程度。领航员和剧团有责任在演出过程中最大限度地创造条件，让更多的人参与进来。无法克服参与障碍可能会导致个人完全被排除在活动之外。

The conductor's role is subtle here as she works with the audience to maximise the agency of the participant to generate the "text," through the volunteering of and performance of the stories that are told and enacted. Maximising theatricality and working to create an environment in which adults are enticed to playfulness are primary factors if the performance is to ride the tension of participation wave. The process is dialectic and calls forth the agency of the participant as risk-taker and storyteller and the agency of the conductor as ritual shaman, theatre producer and host[19].

在此，领航员的作用是微妙的，她与观众合作，通过自愿讲述和表演故事，最大限度地发挥参与者生成"文本"的作用。要想让演出乘上参与浪潮的紧张感，最大限度地发挥戏剧性并努力创造一个能吸引成年人玩乐的环境是首要因素。这一过程是辩证的，需要参与者作为冒险者和讲故事者的能动性，以及领航员作为仪式巫师、戏剧制作人和主持人的能动性[19]。
