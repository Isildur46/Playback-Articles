# Abstract

# 摘要

In the fall of 2022, Mickie Marie, Associate Professor of Theatre and Lighting Designer at Ball State University Department of Theatre and Dance consulted with Spotlight Players, the local Playback Theatre troupe in Muncie, Idiana, to incorporate lighting elements into their repertoire. Over several rehearsals, the troupe learned fundamental aspects of lighting design, such as intensity, movement, visibility, and mood, and were able to integrate that knowledge into existing playback forms. The troupe finished the project with two invited rehearsals to solicit audience feedback on the work they had done.  The process has been summarized in this article.

2022 年秋天，波尔州立大学戏剧与舞蹈系戏剧副教授兼灯光设计师米基-玛丽与当地的一人一故事剧团"聚光灯剧团"（Spotlight Players）合作，将灯光元素融入剧目中。经过多次排练，剧团学会了灯光设计的基本要素，如强度、运动、可见度和情绪，并能将这些知识融入现有的一人一故事形式中。剧团在项目结束时进行了两次邀请排练，以征求观众对他们所做工作的反馈意见。 本文对整个过程进行了总结。

# Introduction

# 引言

My aspirations for this exploratory project were to create a lighting design methodology for Playback Theatre performances; to develop a system incorporating lighting design techniques to support the playback forms with the community troupe Spotlight Players located in Muncie, Indiana (USA). Initially, I would create a system by which I would use specific lighting techniques to enhance specific short forms. For example, low-angle side lighting may be used during a short form (such as fluids) or use traditional front light during long form story. When I design lights for a traditional theatre performance, the story is contained within the script, and I analyze the story and apply my design aesthetic to the overall concept of the production. My goal is to enhance and support the story being told on stage. Lighting for Playback Theatre, the goal remains the same, but since the story is improvised, the lighting must be as flexible in its execution as the actors themselves.

我对这一探索性项目的期望是，为一人一故事剧场的演出创造一种灯光设计方法；开发一个包含灯光设计技术的系统，以支持位于美国印第安纳州曼希的社区剧团"聚光灯剧团"的一人一故事剧场。最初，我将建立一个系统，使用特定的照明技术来加强特定的短形式。例如，在短（如流动塑像）中使用低角度侧面照明，在长形式中使用传统的正面照明。当我为传统戏剧表演设计灯光时，故事包含在剧本中，我分析故事，并将我的设计美学应用到制作的整体概念中。我的目标是加强和支持舞台上正在讲述的故事。为一人一故事剧场设计灯光的目标是不变的，但由于故事是即兴创作的，因此灯光必须像演员本身一样灵活。

The thought was to apply a lighting design aesthetic onto the troupe’s performance, but the more I learned about playback’s methodology, and engaged with Spotlight Players, it became clear my original approach needed to be modified. Instead, I focused on ways to integrate lighting into existing forms, and possibly create new forms that were lighting-centric, to further enhance the core purpose of Playback Theatre: validating an audience member’s story. My approach shifted from *me* creating a methodology to giving the actors the tools to create a methodology for *themselves*. I started by giving all the members of the troupe some fundamental lighting knowledge, such as what we can control within lighting, and then let them create techniques that used that knowledge to enhance the story being told. Much the way a playback actor uses a scarf, or a prop, or a musical instrument, they can also use a flashlight, or clip light, or a table lamp. This approach felt more in line with the spirit of Playback Theatre, where many performances exist in found spaces, with no traditional theatre technology available. It also places the power of design within the hands of the troupe and gives light an equal footing with music and props (Figure 1). Additionally, this approach does not require anyone in the troupe to have extensive training in lighting design techniques, nor does it require them to find someone who is trained to be a part of their process. Instead, it allows the troupe to use light to create the environment in the moment, based on how they feel the moment needs to look. Over the course of this project, I met with Spotlight Players (the local Playback Theatre Troupe) for seven rehearsals and explored fundamental aspects of lighting and playback. For the final two rehearsals we invited some audience members to observe the work and offer feedback on what they saw.  In this article, I have summarized much of the knowledge and techniques we explored throughout the rehearsal process in the Fall of 2022.

我的想法是将灯光设计美学应用到剧团的表演中，但随着我对一人一故事剧场的深入了解，以及与聚光灯剧团的更多接触，我发现我原来的方法需要修改。取而代之的是，我把重点放在了如何将灯光融入现有的表演形式中，以及如何创造以灯光为中心的新形式，以进一步增强一人一故事剧场的核心目的：确证观众的故事。我的工作从*我*创造一种方法转变为给演员提供工具，让他们为*他们自己*创造一种方法，来助力他们对故事的演绎。我首先向剧团的所有成员传授一些基本的灯光知识，比如我们可以通过灯光控制什么，然后让他们利用这些知识创造技巧，以增强故事的感染力。就像一故事演员使用彩布、装置或乐器一样，他们也可以使用手电筒、夹式灯或台灯。这种方法更符合一人一故事剧场的精神，因为一人一故事剧场的许多表演都是在现成的空间里进行的，没有传统的剧场技术可用。它还将设计权交到了剧团手中，并赋予灯光和音乐、装置同等的地位（图 1）。此外，这种方法不要求剧团中的任何人接受过灯光设计技术方面的广泛培训，也不要求他们找到受过培训的人来参与他们的工作。相反，它允许剧团根据自己的感觉，用灯光来营造当下的环境。在这个项目中，我与当地的一人一故事剧团（Spotlight Players）进行了七次排练，探讨了灯光和一人一故事的基本问题。在最后两次排练中，我们邀请了一些观众来观摩演出，并就他们所看到的提出反馈意见。在本文中，我总结了我们在 2022 年秋季排练过程中探索的许多知识和技巧。

# Parameters

# 限定条件

As I planned the early stages of the project, I wanted to make it as accessible as possible to as many different playback troupes as I could. My goal now was to document the process we went through so that others could build on what we had done without needing extensive knowledge of lighting design or technology. My first parameter I placed on myself was that I would only use lighting devices that were easily obtained from local hardware stores. I didn’t want the technology to be controllable using computers or lighting consoles. I wanted the technology to be accessible to a variety of people regardless of their comfort with technology. All of our fixtures were purchased at the local hardware store, but with the advances in LED technology, we were able to get some remote-control color changing lights to add a bit of spectacle.

在计划项目的早期阶段，我希望尽可能让更多不同的剧团都能参与进来。我现在的目标是记录下我们所经历的过程，这样其他人就可以在我们所做的基础上再接再厉，而不需要丰富的灯光设计或技术知识。我给自己设定的第一个限定条件是，我只能使用从当地五金店很容易买到的照明设备。我不想用电脑或照明控制台来控制这项技术。我希望不同的人都能使用这种技术，无论他们对技术是否熟悉。我们所有的灯具都是在当地五金店购买的，但随着 LED 技术的发展，我们还能买到一些遥控变色灯，以增加一些奇观。

The other parameter I set for myself was that I wanted to ensure all the devices were able to be controlled by various members of the troupe in the moment and were not reliant on one member to sit at a “*control console*” to operate the lights. The majority of the devices we used were flashlights, clip lights, and decorative lights that could easily be moved around and reset during the setup phase of a form. (Figure 1) With these parameters in place, the troupe and I began to explore light.

我为自己设定的另一个限定条件是，我希望确保所有设备都能由剧团的不同成员在现场控制，而不是依赖一名成员坐在"*控制台*"前操作灯光。我们使用的大部分设备都是手电筒、夹式灯和装饰灯，在某些形式演绎前的就位阶段，它们能很容易地移动和重置。（图 1）有了这些限定条件之后，我和剧团就开始探索灯光了。

*图 1 讲述者说完后，演员走进空间，坐在地上。她把手电筒放在两膝之间，对准自己的脸，观众立刻认出，这个人现在正在电脑上批改试卷，就像讲述者所说的那样。*

# The Fundamentals of Light

# 灯光的基础要素

In our first rehearsal, I broke down the very basic fundamentals of lighting design which are the controllable qualities of light and the functions of stage lighting. I used Richard Dunham’s text Stage Lighting: The Fundamentals (Dunham, 2019) as a reference point for all the information given to the troupe. When discussing the controllable qualities of light, I generally refer to these as the “*what*” of lighting. What am I doing with this light? What am I changing or manipulating? The qualities of light according to Dunham are: Intensity, Angle, Movement, and Color. When applying the qualities of light, we ask “*what is that light doing*?”, but we do not ask “*why?”* the light has been designed that way. I consider the functions of stage lighting to be the “*why*?”. The more prominent functions according to Dunham are Visibility, Focus, Modeling, and Mood.

在我们的第一次排练中，我分解了灯光设计的基本要素，即光线的可控性和舞台灯光的功能。我使用了理查德-邓纳姆（Richard Dunham）的教材《舞台灯光：基本要素》（邓纳姆，2011 年）作为参考，为剧团提供所有信息。在讨论灯光的可控性时，我一般将其称为灯光的"*什么*"。我在用这束光做什么？我要改变或操纵什么？根据杜纳姆的观点，光线的特质包括强度、角度、运动和色彩。在运用光的特质时，我们会问"*这束光在做什么*？"，但我们不会问"*为什么*？"这束光是这样设计的。我认为舞台灯光的功能本身就是"*为什么*？"。根据邓纳姆的观点，比较突出的功能是可见度、聚焦、造型和情绪。

# Qualities of Light

# 光的特质

The first controllable quality we discussed was intensity, which refers to how bright the light is. In a live environment (one in which the audience is seeing the performance with their own eyes as opposed to on a screen), the intensity is relative to the rest of the environment. A flashlight will appear very bright in a pitch-black room compared to outside in the bright sunlight. We discussed how moving a flashlight closer to your face will make the light appear brighter on your face and moving it further away will decrease the brightness. We played with changing intensity just by adjusting the proximity of the light to the subject (Figure 2).

我们讨论的第一个可控品质是强度，指灯光的亮度。在现场环境中（观众用自己的眼睛观看表演，而不是在屏幕上观看表演），光的强度是相对于环境其他部分而言的。与室外明亮的阳光相比，手电筒在漆黑的房间里会显得非常亮。我们讨论了将手电筒移近脸部会使光线在脸上显得更亮，而将手电筒移远则会降低亮度。我们仅仅通过调整手电筒与被摄体的距离来改变光的强度（图 2）。

![Exploring%20Light%20for%20Playback%20Theatre/image2.jpeg](Exploring%20Light%20for%20Playback%20Theatre/image2.jpeg)

Figure 2

图 2

We then discussed angle of light which refers to where the light is coming from relative to the actor and the audience. Is the light directly above the actor or is it below the face of the actor? Is the light coming from the left side of the actor or maybe directly behind them creating a halo effect? Movement was the third quality we discussed and that refers to the physical movement of the light in the space or on the actor as well as the change in intensity such as dimming. In our early explorations with flashlights, movement was one quality that was very prominent for the actors because the very act of turning the flashlight on and off is part of the quality of movement. The troupe also explored the idea of shaking the light to simulate fear and moving the light above them to simulate flickering lights. The last quality we discussed was color, which in this case refers both to saturated colors like blue and red, but also to tones of neutral white light such as warm white or cool white. We discussed how color is also relative and a cool white light might look very warm in comparison to a deep blue environment.

然后，我们讨论了光线的角度，这是指光线相对于演员和观众而言来自何处。光线是在演员的正上方，还是在演员的脸部下方？光线是来自演员的左侧，还是直接在演员身后产生光晕效果？运动是我们讨论的第三个特质，指的是光线在空间或演员身上的物理运动，以及强度的变化，如变暗。在我们早期对手电筒的探索中，对演员来说，运动是一个非常突出的特质，因为打开和关闭手电筒的行为本身就是运动特质的一部分。剧团还探索了晃动手电筒以模拟恐惧的想法，以及移动手电筒以模拟灯光闪烁的想法。我们讨论的最后一个特质是色彩，这里的色彩既指蓝色和红色等饱和色，也指暖色调或冷色调等中性白光。我们讨论了色彩也是相对的，冷白光与深蓝色环境相比可能会显得非常温暖。

# The Functions of Stage Lighting

# 舞台灯光的功能

The first (and in my opinion, the most important) function of light is visibility. Can I adequately see the things I’m supposed to see? Visibility ties in directly to intensity. If something is not visible, it is highly likely we need to change the intensity of some lights to achieve that visibility. The reason I consider this one the most important is because if we cannot adequately see the thing we are supposed to look at, then we become distracted by that inability to clearly see the subject. The second function we discussed was focus. Simply put, focus refers to the attention of the audience. Are they looking at the things they are supposed to look at? Focus is also tied to intensity and frequently the brightest thing on stage will command the most attention of the audience. A really good way to draw focus to something in particular is to make that thing brighter when we want the audience to look at it. We can either increase the light on the subject to make it brighter, or we can decrease the light on everything else to make it brighter by comparison. Modeling was the third function of lighting we discussed. In this case, modeling refers to how three-dimensional objects appear in space. Do they have lots of shadows and highlights or do they appear flat and two dimensional? Modeling is most closely tied to angle of light, as the angle of the light has the most impact on shadows and highlights of a subject. Many examples of light in real-life have at least one bright source, such as the sun, with at least one other dimmer source to create some fill light on the subject. If you are outside in the middle of the day, and it is a clear day, the sun would be the bright source and the sky itself would be filling in some shadows. The last function we discussed was mood. In this case, mood refers to whether the lighting supports the overall feeling or emotion of whatever is happening on stage. Color can play a large part in the mood of a composition, but angle and intensity can also impact the mood. All of the qualities must work together to create a particular mood, and mood is frequently one of the more difficult functions to achieve simply based on how many variables of lighting make up a stage composition. In Dunham’s text, he elaborates on a few other functions such as establishing a scene, composition, style, rhythm, and staging the story. For the purposes of this project and for simplicity with the troupe, I emphasized the four functions of visibility, focus, modeling, and mood as the main ones to focus on.

灯光的第一个（也是我认为最重要的）功能是可见度。我能充分看到我应该看到的东西吗？可见度与强度直接相关。如果某些东西不可见，我们很可能需要改变某些灯光的强度，以达到可见的效果。我之所以认为这一点最重要，是因为如果我们无法充分看到我们应该看的东西，那么我们就会因为无法清楚地看到主体而分心。我们讨论的第二个功能是聚焦。简单地说，聚焦指的是观众的注意力。他们是否在看他们应该看的东西？聚焦还与强度有关，舞台上最亮的东西往往会吸引观众最多的注意力。要吸引观众的注意力，一个非常好的方法就是当我们想让观众看某样东西时，让它变得更亮。我们可以增加主体上的光线，使其更亮，也可以减少其他事物上的光线，使其相比之下更亮。造型是我们讨论的灯光的第三个功能。在这里，造型指的是三维物体在空间中的外观。它们是有很多阴影和高光，还是显得扁平和二维？造型与光线角度的关系最为密切，因为光线角度对拍摄对象的阴影和高光影响最大。现实生活中的许多光线实例都至少有一个明亮的光源，如太阳，同时至少还有一个较暗的光源，为拍摄对象提供一些补光。如果你在中午时分外出，天气晴朗，那么太阳就是明亮的光源，而天空本身会填充一些阴影。我们讨论的最后一个功能是情绪。在这里，情绪指的是灯光是否支持舞台上发生的任何事情的整体感觉或情绪。色彩对构图的情绪有很大影响，但角度和强度也会影响情绪。所有的特质都必须相互配合，才能创造出一种特定的情绪，而情绪往往是最难实现的功能之一，这仅仅是因为构成舞台构图的灯光变量太多。在邓纳姆的文章中，他还阐述了其他一些功能，如建立场景、构图、风格、节奏和故事舞台。为了本项目的目的，也为了与剧团进行简单的交流，我强调了可见度、聚焦、造型和情绪这四种功能，并将其作为重点。

After discussing these ideas with the troupe, the rest of the first rehearsal was spent with each member of the troupe experimenting with a flashlight on themselves. Many of the experiments that evolved from that rehearsal explored direction and movement, and how the actor could dynamically shift the direction of the light to emphasize a point they were trying to make. Modeling and mood were frequently discussed as they tried to achieve particular emotions or evoke certain feelings. We also looked at a couple different light bulbs that were purchased from the local hardware store that had different colors of white light. We discussed how the varying shades of white can evoke certain feelings such as how warm white and cool white light can make someone feel differently. I then asked the troupe to pay attention to their surroundings over the next week before we met again and to see if they could identify different qualities of light and how they may have impacted certain things like visibility, focus, modeling, and mood.

在与剧团讨论了这些想法之后，第一次排练的剩余时间是让剧团的每个成员用手电筒在自己身上做实验。从这次排练中产生的许多实验探讨了方向和动作，以及演员如何动态地改变光线的方向来强调他们想要表达的观点。我们还经常讨论造型和情绪问题，因为他们试图达到特定的情绪或唤起特定的感觉。我们还看了几个从当地五金店买来的不同灯泡，它们发出不同颜色的白光。我们讨论了不同色调的白光如何唤起特定的感觉，例如暖白光和冷白光如何让人产生不同的感觉。然后，我要求剧团在接下来的一周里，在我们再次见面之前，注意观察他们周围的环境，看看他们是否能辨别出光线的不同品质，以及它们可能会如何影响某些事情，如可见度、聚焦、造型和情绪。

# Exploration of Light

# 灯光的探索

As the troupe continued to meet and consider the integration of lighting into their forms, the exploration we did in that first rehearsal formed the basis of the warm up that happened at each rehearsal, and ultimately would evolve into the audience warm up we performed at our two invited rehearsals. The conductor of the troupe would provide a prompt for the troupe, and they would spend a minute or two exploring with their own flashlight before playing that prompt back to the troupe. Some of the earliest prompts were more of titles that the actor would recite back to the troupe, after deciding on an emotion, or movement to convey their feelings, such as *“I found ten dollars”,* or *“I got a bad grade on my test”.* Some of the exploration that evolved from these prompts included using the flashlight to represent the ten dollars as it shined on the face of the actor, or using the flashlight to imitate a cell phone as the actor pretended to text their friend that they got a bad grade on the test. In these cases, the flashlight was not only a source of light for the actor, but also became a representation of important information, as well as imitated everyday objects. In later rehearsals, we prompted the actors with an emotion only, and let them decide how to use the flashlight to help convey that emotion. Having the actors understand some of the fundamentals of lighting such as angle and intensity became integral in their understanding of how the light was playing on themselves. One evolution of this exercise saw the actors moving the lights frantically around to simulate energized intensity, or light themselves from different angles to convey subtle emotional shifts.  One of the key ideas that evolved from this exercise was that a flashlight can be used to represent something, it can be used as a traditional light source to direct the audience’s attention, and it can also be used simply as a prop flashlight.

剧团继续碰面并考虑将灯光融入他们的表演形式，我们在第一次排练中所做的探索形成了每次排练热身的基础，并最终演变成我们在两次受邀排练中为观众所做的热身。剧团的领航员会给剧团提供一个提示，他们会用自己的手电筒探索一两分钟，然后再把提示放回给剧团。最早的一些提示更像是标题，演员在决定一种情绪或动作来表达自己的感受后，会吟诵给剧团听，比如*"我捡到了十块钱"*或*"我考试成绩不好"*。根据这些提示进行的一些探索，包括：用手电筒代表十美元，照在演员的脸上；或者用手电筒模仿手机，演员假装给朋友发短信说考试成绩不好。在这些情况下，手电筒不仅是演员的光源，还成为了重要信息的代表，以及日常物品的替代。在后来的排练中，我们只提示演员一种情绪，让他们决定如何使用手电筒来帮助传达这种情绪。让演员们了解照明的一些基本原理，如角度和强度，这对他们理解光线如何作用于自己是不可或缺的。这一练习的一个演变过程是，演员们疯狂地移动手电筒，模拟充满能量的强度，或从不同角度照亮自己，以传达微妙的情感变化。从这一练习中产生的一个重要点子是，手电筒可以用来表现某些事物，也可以用作传统光源来引导观众的注意力，还可以仅仅用作装置。

The exercises then evolved from having one actor use the flashlight on themselves, to partnered work in which one actor would shine the flashlight on the other. The parameter for this exercise was that they were not allowed to discuss their intentions with their partner, but rather were trying to listen and react to what the actor of the pair was doing. We then evolved that exercise to be a trio, one actor and two people with flashlights. These early explorations added varying levels of complexity to the warm ups and forced the troupe to develop a vocabulary and method for these different parts. When the troupe was in pairs or trios, the people with the flashlights who were more supportive of the actor were referred to as “*auxiliaries*”. When working as pairs or trios, one of the recurring complexities of these exercises was how to start and end the moment. Does the actor begin, and the auxiliaries follow? How do the auxiliaries know when the actor is finished with the moment? What do the auxiliaries do when the moment is over? All these questions occurred numerous times, and eventually the troupe evolved a methodology and a consistent “*language*” for the lighting. The evolution of this particular methodology saw the auxiliaries get into place first, then when the actor saw they were set, the actor would step into the space to begin the scene. The auxiliaries would use their flashlights to either light the actor in a traditional sense, or sometimes they would use the light more representationally. The actor would progress through their scene, and when they were done, there would be a moment of stillness. At the moment of stillness, the auxiliaries would know the scene was ending and would also still themselves. Then, on the lead of the actor, everyone would shift to a neutral body position and place their hand on their heart to acknowledge the teller of the story.  This language formed the basis for how the troupe began and ended several different forms while integrating lighting.

然后，练习从让一名演员用手电筒照自己，发展到让一名演员用手电筒照另一名演员。这个练习的参数是，他们不能与搭档讨论自己的意图，而是要努力倾听搭档的演员在做什么，并做出反应。后来，我们将这一练习发展为三人组，即一名演员和两名手持手电筒的人。这些早期的探索为热身增加了不同程度的复杂性，并迫使剧团为这些不同的部分制定词汇和方法。当剧团两人或三人合作时，手持手电筒、更支持演员的人被称为 "*辅助人*"。在两人或三人合作时，这些练习中反复出现的一个复杂问题是如何开始和结束这一时刻。是演员开始，辅助人员跟随吗？辅助人员如何知道演员何时结束？当时刻结束时，辅助人员该做什么？所有这些问题都曾多次出现，最终剧团形成了一套方法和一致的灯光 "*语言*"。在这一特殊方法的演变过程中，辅助人员首先就位，然后当演员看到他们已经就位时，演员就会步入空间开始场景。辅助人员会用手电筒为演员进行传统意义上的照明，有时也会使用更具代表性的灯光。演员将在自己的场景中表演，表演结束后，会有一个静止的瞬间。在静止的那一刻，辅助人员会知道场景结束了，他们自己也会静止。然后，在演员的带领下，每个人都会换一个中立的身体姿势，并将手放在自己的心上，向故事的讲述者致谢。 这种语言构成了剧团在整合灯光时如何开始和结束几种不同形式的基础。

# Integrating Color and Scarves

# 整合色彩和围巾

After three rehearsals of exploration with just flashlights, we started to incorporate area lights, scarves, and color-changing lights. I used another section of Dunham’s text to elaborate on the psychological effects of color. We discussed the difference between warm light (which has more red, yellow, or orange in the mix) and cool light (which has more blue, green, or lavender in the mix). Dunham describes how warmer light tends to evoke feelings of excitement or energy, while cooler light tends to evoke feelings of peacefulness or tranquility. We then talked about a few of the more prominent colors and what kinds of emotions they might evoke. Many of these colors have both a positive and negative association, depending on context:

在仅使用手电筒进行了三次排练之后，我们开始使用区域灯、围巾和变色灯。我使用了邓纳姆的另一篇文章来阐述色彩的心理效应。我们讨论了暖光（混合了更多的红色、黄色或橙色）和冷光（混合了更多的蓝色、绿色或淡紫色）之间的区别。德纳姆描述了暖色调的光线如何唤起兴奋或活力的感觉，而冷色调的光线如何唤起宁静或安详的感觉。然后，我们讨论了几种比较突出的颜色以及它们可能唤起的情绪。其中许多颜色都有正面和负面的联想，具体取决于语境：

- Red – Passion, energy, excitement, lust, aggression, evil.
- Pink – Femininity, sexuality, pleasing on skin tones.
- Yellow – optimism, confidence, frustration, anger.
- Orange – Warmth, passion, safety, fun, assurance.
- Green – Balance, harmony, tranquility, boredom, stagnation, illness.
- Blue – Calmness, serenity, reflection, distance.

- 红色--激情、活力、兴奋、欲望、侵略性、邪恶。
- 粉色--女性、性感、肤色悦目。
- 黄色--乐观、自信、沮丧、愤怒。
- 橙色--温暖、热情、安全、有趣、自信。
- 绿色--平衡、和谐、宁静、无聊、停滞、疾病。
- 蓝色--平静、安详、思考、距离。

When thinking of color, in a traditional process, I would order gel filters to put into the lights to change the colors. For this project and the self-imposed limitations, we decided to use scarves to change the colors of lights. We had two clip lights with warm white LED light bulbs, and we draped the scarf over the light to simulate a gel filter and change the color of the light. This was an interesting process of exploration because we had a number of scarves in different colors, but also in different levels of translucency. Additionally, several of the scarves were multicolored, which added a different wrinkle into this exploration. When using the scarves that were more sheer, the color of the light was changed in a more subtle way, mimicking more neutral warm/cool white light. When using the thicker scarves, the color of the light was changed more dramatically, but also reduced the brightness of the light, so the troupe was able to play with color as well as intensity during this exercise. During our first invited rehearsal, one of the audience members commented how the more sheer scarves seemed more effective because it changed the color in a way that was noticeable but did not diminish the light and make it too dark. One note regarding safety: we constantly checked the temperature of both the lights and the scarves to ensure they were never getting too hot. Since we were using LED lights, the bulbs never got hot enough so we couldn’t touch them with our bare hands, even after being on for two hours. It is very important to understand that this may not work for all lights because of how hot some light bulbs can get.

在考虑色彩时，按照传统工艺，我会订购凝胶滤色片，放入灯光中改变颜色。对于这个项目和自我限制，我们决定用围巾来改变灯光的颜色。我们有两个装有暖白色 LED 灯泡的夹子灯，我们把围巾披在灯上，模拟胶状滤光片，改变灯光的颜色。这是一个有趣的探索过程，因为我们有许多不同颜色、不同透光度的围巾。此外，有几条围巾是五颜六色的，这也为我们的探索增添了不同的色彩。当使用较薄的围巾时，光线的颜色会发生较微妙的变化，模拟出较中性的暖/冷白光。当使用较厚的围巾时，光线的颜色变化更为明显，但同时也降低了光线的亮度。在我们第一次受邀排练时，一位观众评论说，更薄的围巾似乎更有效，因为它改变颜色的方式很明显，但不会减弱光线，也不会让光线太暗。关于安全问题：我们经常检查灯光和围巾的温度，以确保它们不会太热。由于我们使用的是 LED 灯，灯泡的温度一直不高，所以即使灯亮了两个小时，我们也不能用手触摸它们。重要的是要明白，由于有些灯泡的温度很高，这种方法不一定适用于所有的灯。

# Evolution of Basic Short Forms

# 基本短剧的演变

Throughout the rehearsal process of this project, the exploration of the flashlights became a prominent component for the troupe. There were several existing Playback Theatre forms that we explored and experimented with using the flashlights and the scarves. Of these different forms, we chose three that we felt were sufficiently rehearsed to be able to play for an audience. For our first rehearsal with an invited audience, we started with the audience warm-up, moved into Pairs, then Narrative V, then Fluids.

在本项目的整个排练过程中，对手电筒的探索成为剧团的一个重要组成部分。我们利用手电筒和围巾探索和尝试了几种现有的 Playback Theatre 形式。在这些不同的形式中，我们选择了三种我们认为已经充分排练过的形式，以便为观众表演。在与受邀观众进行的第一次排练中，我们从观众热身开始，然后进入 "双人舞"，接着是 "叙事 V"，最后是 "流动塑像"。

When setting up the room, we had two wooden coat trees that had all the scarves hanging on them. Mounted on top of the coat trees were the two clip lights providing some area light to the stage area.  (Figure 3) Draped on the back wall behind the actors was a string of color changing LED’s with the remote control sitting near the actors. We also had a string of Christmas lights laid out on the floor to act as front of the stage boundary.

在布置房间时，我们准备了两棵木制衣帽树，上面挂满了围巾。衣帽树上安装了两盏夹子灯，为舞台区域提供一些区域照明。 (图 3）演员身后的后墙上挂着一串变色 LED 灯，遥控器就放在演员附近。我们还在地板上铺设了一串圣诞灯，作为舞台前方的边界。

For our first invited rehearsal, we ran through each form a couple times to give the audience some different perspectives. For the second invited rehearsal, we performed all the forms under a neutral “*work-light*” environment and did not use any flashlights or clip lights. Then we did the forms again, incorporating the lighting elements we had been exploring. The second rehearsal was designed to give the audience a view of the forms with and without the added lighting so they could see and compare the two styles.

在第一次受邀彩排中，我们对每种形式都进行了几次演练，以便给观众提供一些不同的视角。第二次彩排时，我们在中性的 "*工作光*"环境下表演了所有形式，没有使用任何手电筒或夹子灯。然后，我们将之前探索过的灯光元素融入其中，再次进行了表演。第二次排练的目的是让观众看到有灯光和没有灯光的表演，这样他们就能看到并比较两种风格。

# Audience Warm Up

# 观众热身

As each performance began, the conductor asked the audience some general questions about how they were feeling as the year was coming to an end. Several of the answers were things like “*excited*”, “*nervous*”, “*anxious*”, “*hopeful*”. Each time a feeling was shared, the conductor would indicate an actor in the troupe who would play that feeling back. Under the “*worklight*” setup, they did not use flashlights, but under the other setups, they did use a flashlight and maybe a scarf. This audience warm-up mimicked the warm-ups we did in the early explorations and helped to warm up the actors, the conductor, and the audience.

每场演出开始时，领航员都会向观众提出一些一般性问题，询问他们在年末的感受。有几个问题的答案是 "*兴奋*"、"*紧张*"、"*焦虑*"、"*希望*"。每次分享一种感觉时，领航员就会指出剧团中的一名演员，由他来演绎这种感觉。在 "*工作灯*"的设置下，他们没有使用手电筒，但在其他设置下，他们使用了手电筒，也许还用了围巾。这种观众热身模仿了我们在早期探索中所做的热身，有助于演员、领航员和观众的热身。

# Pairs

# 配对

After the audience warm-up, we continued in the spirit of using emotions as the basis for the forms as we moved into Pairs. During one of the rehearsals, one audience member was in town visiting her daughter, but her home was far away. She described how she felt lots of love being in town with her daughter, but she was much more comfortable at home. The troupe used the form to show the two different feelings of “*love*” and “*comfort*”. During the early exploration with flashlights and scarves, the troupe determined that this form was much more effective without the flashlights, as they felt the flashlights were more of a hindrance in this case. For each emotion described, one pair chose a scarf to change the color of the clip light to represent that emotion but did not use flashlights within the form. We also adapted the form a bit, and had each pair playing back the same emotion, rather than playing the different emotions, so that the color chosen on one side of the stage would represent the same emotion for both members of the pair. In this instance, the stage left pair chose a pink scarf and draped it over the clip light on stage left, and then they both played back “*love*”. The stage right pair chose an orange scarf to change the color of the light and played back “*comfort*”. (Figure 4)

观众热身结束后，我们继续秉承以情感为基础的精神，开始了配对表演。在一次排练中，一位观众来城里看望她的女儿，但她的家在很远的地方。她描述了自己在城里和女儿在一起时感受到的爱，但她在家里更自在。剧团用这种形式表现了 "*爱*"和 "*舒适*"两种不同的感受。在使用手电筒和围巾进行早期探索的过程中，剧团认为，如果不使用手电筒，这种形式的效果会更好，因为他们觉得手电筒在这种情况下更像是一种障碍。每描述一种情绪，就有一对人选择一条围巾来改变夹子灯的颜色，以代表该情绪，但没有在表格中使用手电筒。我们还对表格进行了一些调整，让每对选手演绎相同的情绪，而不是播放不同的情绪，这样舞台一侧选择的颜色就能代表这对选手的相同情绪。在这个例子中，舞台左侧的两人选择了一条粉色围巾，把它披在舞台左侧的剪辑灯上，然后他们都播放了 "*爱*"。舞台右侧的两人选择了一条橙色围巾，改变了灯光的颜色，并播放了 "*舒适*"。（图 4）

This adaptation was highly effective because the color became the central lighting element that enhanced the emotion, and the pair was able to play into the color by shifting their proximity to the light. In another rehearsal, one audience described feelings of “*excitement*” but also “*nervousness*” about the new school year starting. In this moment, the actors chose an orange scarf to represent excitement, and a blue scarf to represent nervousness. The audience feedback of this was generally positive with several audience responses indicating they liked the use of the scarves to show the contrast of the emotions. As the troupe continues to explore lighting in the spring semester, they will continue to explore and discover which scarves are most effective in changing the color of the light.

这种改编非常有效，因为色彩成了烘托情绪的核心照明元素，而这对搭档也能够通过改变他们与灯光的距离来融入色彩。在另一次排练中，一位观众描述了对新学年开始的 "*兴奋*"和 "*紧张*"的感觉。此时，演员们选择了一条橙色围巾代表兴奋，一条蓝色围巾代表紧张。观众对此的反馈普遍积极，有几位观众表示喜欢用围巾来表现情绪的对比。随着剧团在春季学期继续探索灯光，他们将继续探索和发现哪条围巾最能有效地改变灯光的颜色。

# Narrative V

# 叙事 V

From Pairs we asked the audience to tell us a story about “*one door closing and another opening*”. One audience member described a situation in which she heard a noise under her porch. She went to investigate and found a kitten. The troupe used Narrative V to play this story back and the only adaptation we made to this form was that the troupe was able to use flashlights within the form if they felt it made sense. One actor used the flashlight to mimic a headlamp, while another used it as a flashlight pretending to look under the porch. The third actor batted the flashlight around on the ground pretending to be a kitten. This method of using the flashlight became a favorite of the troupe as it was highly effective seeing all the flashlights used in the same way, but then each time the actors rotated, they were able to come up with unique ways to use the flashlights and build off what the other had done before them. Another audience member told a story about growing in their relationship with their significant other and titled it “*Unexpected Growth.*” The troupe used the flashlight in a variety of ways to indicate growth. One actor shined the light on the ground and moved it up and down to literally make the circle of light grow. Another hid the light and slowly uncovered it to “*grow*” the illumination. Numerous symbolic and representational uses of the flashlights were discovered during Narrative V in the rehearsals.

从 "对对碰 "开始，我们请听众给我们讲一个关于 "*一扇门关上，另一扇门打开*"的故事。一位听众讲述了这样一个故事：她听到门廊下有响声。她去调查，发现了一只小猫。剧团用叙事 V 演绎了这个故事，我们对这种形式唯一的改编是，如果剧团认为有意义，可以在形式中使用手电筒。一位演员用手电筒模仿头灯，另一位演员则把手电筒当作手电筒，假装在门廊下寻找。第三位演员将手电筒在地上拍打，假装自己是一只小猫。这种使用手电筒的方法成了剧团的最爱，因为看到所有手电筒都以同样的方式使用，效果非常好，但每次演员轮换时，他们都能想出独特的方法来使用手电筒，并在前人的基础上更上一层楼。另一位观众讲述了自己与另一半关系成长的故事，并将其命名为 "*意外的成长"。剧团以各种方式使用手电筒来表示成长。一位演员将手电筒照在地上，然后上下移动，使光圈不断扩大。另一位演员将手电筒藏起来，然后慢慢揭开，使照明 "*生长*"。在排练 "叙事 V "时，我们发现了手电筒的许多象征性和代表性用途。

# Fluids

# 流动塑像

The last form we explored for the audience was Fluids. This form was jokingly referred to as our “*free-for-all*” form because we didn’t put any limitations or parameters on the actors. If they wanted to use a flashlight, they could, but were not required to. They could change the color of the background lights, they could drape a scarf to change the color of the area lights, they could do whatever felt right in the moment. In one rehearsal, an audience member told a story of how they write out clues for a scavenger hunt for their kids for Christmas. One actor used the flashlight to represent the kid searching for the clues, while another changed the background lights to red to represent Christmas time. One actor chose not to use a flashlight at all and an audience member commented that the variety was really effective with the different uses of the scarves and lights.

我们为观众探索的最后一种形式是 "流动塑像"。这种形式被戏称为我们的 "*自由*"形式，因为我们没有给演员设置任何限制或参数。如果他们想使用手电筒，可以，但不是必须。他们可以改变背景灯光的颜色，可以披上一条围巾来改变区域灯光的颜色，他们可以做任何当时觉得合适的事情。在一次排练中，一位观众讲述了他们如何为孩子们写出圣诞节寻宝游戏的线索。一位演员用手电筒代表寻找线索的孩子，而另一位演员则把背景灯换成红色，代表圣诞节。一位演员选择完全不使用手电筒，而一位观众则评论说，围巾和灯光的不同使用方式真的很有效果。

# Conclusion

# 结论

This project was an excellent first step for the troupe in regard to true integration of light into the forms. In just a few short weeks, they were able to absorb a tremendous amount of lighting information and were able to integrate and execute lighting fundamentals, while also retaining the spirit of the forms themselves. When I asked the troupe how they felt about the work they did, one of them responded: *“…lighting seemed a natural progression to utilizing props, cloths, and music as theatrical elements in storytelling. Light helped us create mood and enhance the space we performed in. It had the capacity to transform the environment and therefore stimulate our imagination to envision different scenarios for the stories we told.”* (Veronica Santoyo, Faculty member Ball State University, Department of Theatre and Dance).

对于剧团来说，这个项目是将灯光真正融入表演形式的出色的第一步。在短短几周内，他们吸收了大量的灯光信息，能够整合并执行灯光基础，同时还保留了形式本身的精神。当我问剧团对他们所做的工作有何感想时，其中一人回答说：*"......灯光似乎是一个很好的工具： *"......灯光似乎是利用装置、布料和音乐作为讲故事的戏剧元素的自然发展。灯光帮助我们营造氛围，增强表演空间的效果。它有能力改变环境，从而激发我们的想象力，为我们讲述的故事设想不同的场景。"*（维罗妮卡-桑托约，波尔州立大学戏剧与舞蹈系教师）。

As a final wrap up with the troupe, I asked if they would like to continue exploring with light as they meet in the future. They were all adamant about continuing with that exploration, so I will consult with them as long as they want my assistance. My hope is that other troupes will see the value of incorporating lighting into their repertoire and that this article can be a resource for others to use as they begin to explore the artistic medium of light.

在与剧团的最后总结中，我问他们是否愿意在今后的聚会中继续探索光。他们都坚持要继续探索，所以只要他们需要我的帮助，我就会向他们咨询。我希望其他剧团也能看到将灯光融入剧目的价值，并希望这篇文章能成为其他剧团开始探索灯光艺术媒介时的参考资料。
