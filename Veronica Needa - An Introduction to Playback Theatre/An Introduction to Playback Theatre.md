# 一人一故事剧场简介

Playback Theatre is created through a unique collaboration between performers and audience. Someone tells a story or moment from their life, chooses actors to play the different roles, and then watches as their story is immediately recreated and given artistic shape and coherence.

一人一故事剧场是通过表演者和观众之间的独特合作创造出来的。表演者讲述自己生活中的一个故事或一个瞬间，选择演员扮演不同的角色，然后看着自己的故事被立即重现，并被赋予艺术的形式和连贯性。

**Building community through personal stories -** Playback Theatre creates a ritual space where any story - however ordinary, extraordinary, hidden or difficult - might be told, and immediately made into theatre. And where each person's uniqueness is honoured and affirmed while at the same time building and strengthening our connections to each other as a community of people.

**通过个人故事建立社群 -** 一人一故事剧场创造了一个仪式空间，在这个空间里，任何故事——无论多么平凡、非凡、隐秘或艰难——都可能被讲述出来，并立即在剧场中演绎出来。在这里，每个人的独特性都能得到尊重和肯定，同时还能建立和加强我们作为一个社群的相互联系。

**Origins -** The original Playback Theatre Company came together in 1975, with Jonathan Fox as its director. This was in the mid-Hudson valley of upstate New York and part of the experimental theatre explorations of the 1970s - looking for ways of reaching out to its audience, bringing theatre closer to everyday reality, and breaking away from the tradition of scripted theatre. Since then, Playback Theatre has spread across the world with companies and practitioners in many, many countries. It thrives in a variety of settings, existing as community theatre gatherings as well as a professional service to both the business and social sector.

**起源 -** 一人一故事剧场初始剧团成立于 1975 年，由乔纳森-福克斯（Jonathan Fox）担任团长。当时的剧团位于纽约上州哈德逊河谷中部，是 20 世纪 70 年代实验戏剧探索的一部分——探索如何接触观众，让戏剧更贴近日常现实，并打破剧本戏剧的传统。从那时起，一人一故事剧团遍布世界各地，许多国家都有剧团和实践者。它在各种场合蓬勃发展，既是社群戏剧聚会，也是为商业和社会部门提供的专业服务。

**Some Influences -**

**影响 -***

- **Community ritual & theatre:** Jonathan Fox had lived in Nepal and experienced these deeply embedded into the rhythms of everyday life.
- **社群仪式和戏剧：**乔纳森-福克斯曾在尼泊尔生活，体验过这些深深扎根日常生活中的仪式和戏剧。
- **Oral tradition of storytelling:** where people gather together to hear and share the old stories - the world of myths and legends and folktales.
- **口述故事传统：**人们聚集在一起聆听和分享古老的故事——神话、传说和民间故事的世界。
- **Psychodrama:** while there are differences in form and practice, there are many shared values in Playback Theatre and psychodrama. For example,
- **心理剧：**虽然在形式和实践上存在差异，但一人一故事剧场和心理剧有许多共同的价值。例如
    - spontaneity & creativity as natural expressions of our humanity & essential for well-being
    - 自发性和创造性是人性的自然表达，也是幸福的必要条件
    - inclusiveness – every individual has a place in the collective.
    - 包容性——每个人在集体中都有一席之地。

**The Classic Stage Layout -** Whether in a classroom, hospital, at a business conference or in a theatre, there is always the familiarity of this basic set-up for Playback Theatre. Much magic can happen within this very simple structure.

**经典舞台布置 -** 无论是在教室、医院、商务会议还是在剧场，一人一故事剧场的基本布局总是那么熟悉。在这个非常简单的结构中，可以发生许多神奇的事情。

**Artistic additions** - The Cloth Tree - a selection of coloured cloth draped over a rail or ladder which can be used in the action -is often present but not essential. Some companies may have additional features, for example: upstage there may be a simple curtain on a rail to create a hidden area for the actors to use in the action. Sometimes there may be additional lighting features. These are optional extras. While there are classical performance forms such as Fluid Sculptures, Pairs, Chorus, or Story (also called Scenes or Free Form), each company may also have developed an extra vocabulary of performance forms – narrative or non-narrative short or intermediate forms - with their own ‘house rules’ for them. The artistic possibilities are endless, so long as what happens on stage best reflects, and is in service to, the audience dialogue and encounter - and serving the Tellers with integrity - within a good holding frame.

**艺术性补充** - 在栏杆或梯子上垂下的彩色纱布，可在表演中使用——经常出现，但并非必不可少。有些剧团可能会有一些附加装置，例如：舞台上方可能会有一个简单的帘子，挂在栏杆上，为演员在动作中创造一个隐蔽的区域。有时还可能会有额外的灯光效果。这些都是可选的附加装置。虽然有流动塑像、一对对、大合唱或故事（也称为场景或自由演绎）等经典表演形式，但每个剧团也可能开发了额外的表演形式词汇——叙事或非叙事的短形式或中形式——并有自己的"内部规则"。艺术的可能性是无穷无尽的，只要舞台上发生的一切能够最好地反映并服务于观众的对话和相遇——并在维持良好的框架内为讲述者提供真诚的服务。

**Rhythm of a performance -** There is no script, but there is a rhythm and sequence to a classical Playback Theatre performance. The Conductor is the host and facilitator of the process. Performances will generally begin with a welcome and a period of introductions from the team and a suitable warm-up for the audience to the space and the context. Members of the audience are guided to volunteer something from their experience. These are generally shorter (a feeling or a moment) in the warm-up with the audience in their seats; to longer events and stories, which are invited to be told from a chair on stage to the side, where the audience member now sits beside the Conductor. These may be past, present or future stories. They could be about a very special time or about something that happens every day. In the course of a performance 3, 4 or 5, maybe more, people will come forward to tell a story in this way. Towards the end of a performance, the conductor may invite reflections on the process from the audience, and the team will create some sort of artistic closure appropriate for the event.

**表演的节奏 -** 虽然没有剧本，但典型的一人一故事剧场演出是有节奏和顺序的。领航员是整个过程的主持人和带领者。演出开始时，领航员一般会致欢迎辞，介绍演出团队，并为观众进行适当的热身活动，让他们熟悉演出场地和环境。观众在引导下自愿说出自己的经历。这些内容一般较短（一种感觉或一个瞬间），热身时观众坐在自己的座位上；也有较长的事件和故事，邀请观众坐在舞台一侧的椅子上讲述，观众现在坐在领航员身边。这些故事可以是过去、现在或未来的故事。它们可能是关于一段非常特殊的时光，也可能是关于每天发生的事情。在演出过程中，会有 3、4 或 5 个，甚至更多的人站出来以这种方式讲述故事。在演出接近尾声时，领航员可能会邀请观众对演出过程进行回顾，演出团队也会创作一些适合此次活动的艺术结尾。

**Threads of meaning -** Sometimes a Playback performance may begin with an explicit theme, and the stories are offered following this thread. Sometimes there is no theme to begin with, and the underlying concerns and interests of the community will reveal themselves through the deeper patterning of the stories. This is not always obvious, and a skilful conductor and acting team may be able to bring this to consciousness at the end of the performance.

**意义之线 -** 有时，一人一故事剧场的演出可能会以一个明确的主题开始，故事也会按照这个线索展开。有时，开始时并没有主题，社群的基本关切和兴趣会通过多个故事的深层模式展现出来。这一点并不总是显而易见的，娴熟的领航员和表演团队或许能在演出结束时让人们意识到这一点。

**Sequence of the ‘Story’** - The heart of the playback performance is in the sharing of the longer stories. The earlier process in a Playback Theatre event is designed to warm up the audience to be ready to come forward to sit in the Teller's chair on the side of the stage. Here they are more visible and audible to the audience, and the story is told from this place with the support of the Conductor.

**“故事”的顺序** - 一人一故事剧场演出的核心在于分享较长的故事。一人一故事剧场活动的前期过程是为了让观众热身，准备好上前坐在舞台一侧的讲述者椅子上。在这里，他们更容易被观众看到和听到，在领航员的支持下，故事就从这里开始讲述。

- During the interview, the Teller chooses an actor to play him/herself, and perhaps other actors to play roles in the story. As the actors are chosen, they stand. When the story is told, the Conductor will say 'Lets watch'.
- 在访谈过程中，讲述者会选择一名演员扮演自己，或许还会选择其他演员扮演故事中的角色。选定演员后，他们要起立。故事讲完后，领航员会说"请看"。
- The performers take this as their cue to **set up** for the beginning of the enactment. There may be music to set an atmosphere and mood. The actors may use their boxes or chairs to set the scene.
- 表演者以此为提示，开始准备演绎的开场部分。可能会有音乐来营造气氛和情绪。演员可以用箱子或椅子布置场景。
- During **the enactment**, the actors and musician will spontaneously improvise a re-enactment of the story - with a variety of theatrical possibilities & artistic formats, aiming to present the essence and heart of the story – in a way which is recognised by the Teller.
- 在**演绎**过程中，演员和乐师将自发地即兴重演故事——采用各种戏剧和艺术形式，旨在以讲述者认可的方式呈现故事的精髓和核心。
- At the end of the enactment, the actors look to the Teller as an act of **acknowledgement**.
- 表演结束时，演员们将目光投向讲述者，以示**致意**。
- Then there is a **closure with the Teller**. Facilitated by the conductor this is an opportunity for the Teller to say something if they feel moved to. Often nothing more than a few words are said. Sometimes they are encouraged to say more to ground a strong emotional reaction, or the conductor may refer back to the audience to check how the story has connected with them too. Occasionally the Teller is offered a chance for a correction or a transformation of the scene. And the actors will replay it accordingly. The conductor thanks the Teller and guides them to return to their seat. And then another person is invited to tell the next story, and so on.
- 然后以**对讲述者的后采**来结束。在领航员的协助下，如果讲述者有话要说，这也是一个机会。他们通常只说几句话。有时，他们会被鼓励说更多的话，以表达强烈的情感反应，或者，领航员会向观众询问故事与他们之间的联系。有时，"讲述者"会有机会纠正或改变场景。演员也会据此重新表演。领航员向讲述者表示感谢，并引导他们回到座位上。然后邀请另一个人讲述下一个故事，以此类推。

The simple rules of this sequence form part of the ritual that is a core feature of Playback Theatre.

这一系列简单的规则构成了一人一故事剧场的核心特征——仪式——的一部分。

**Ritual -** There are rules embedded in the practice of Playback Theatre which provide an important container for the whole experience. The ritual creates a framework, a definition for the process, within which the unpredictable and the miraculous can manifest. When the ritual is held well by the conductor and the performers, there is a subconscious sense of safety amongst the audience. And in this atmosphere, the most profound as well as the most everyday of personal stories will feel welcomed and honoured.

**仪式 -** 一人一故事剧场的实践中蕴含着一些规则，这些规则为整个体验提供了一个重要的容器。仪式创造了一个框架，为整个过程下了一个定义，在这个框架内，不可预知的和神奇的事情都可以显现出来。当仪式被领航员和表演者很好地把握时，观众会在潜意识中产生一种安全感。在这种氛围中，最深刻的个人故事和最日常的个人故事都会受到欢迎和尊重。

**Art -** Whether performed as a simple re-enactment or with more sophisticated mise en scène – including abstract movement & sound, dance, with puppets or song or poetry -when the heart of the story is captured with a high level of artistry, there can be profound impact and another level of transformation and healing. When this is witnessed as a spontaneous ensemble creation, it offers a deeper experience of our humanity and collective potential.

**艺术 -** 无论是简单的情景再现，还是更复杂的舞台效果——包括抽象的动作和声音、舞蹈、偶、歌曲或诗——当故事的核心被高度艺术化地捕捉到时，都会产生深远的影响，带来另一个层次的转变和治愈。当我们目睹这种自发的共同创作时，会对我们的人性和集体潜能有更深刻的体验。

**Social Interaction** - Alongside the fundamental principles of Ritual and Art, Playback Theatre also gives attention to the social interaction. The ritual holding and artistic response is only meaningful when it is managed with a good awareness of the social context and gives attention to the whole group experience. This theatre form is in direct service to healing relationship, communication and understanding between people. This is an underlying value, so the conductor interacts directly with the audience with respect and human warmth, and is sensitive to the larger social & political frame of the Playback event. The actors, too, can bring into the action on stage social & political references that are contextually appropriate to the personal story. By listening to these stories we feel and weave the deeper web of our larger story as a community of people and thus tap into the collective and universal experience. Social change and transformation begins here, as we make space for the stories of the community - through individual voices - and are affected by them.

**社会互动** - 除了仪式和艺术的基本原则，一人一故事剧场还关注社会互动。仪式的维持和艺术的回应只有在充分了解社会背景并关注整个群体体验的情况下才有意义。这种戏剧形式直接服务于修复人与人之间的关系、沟通和理解。这是一种潜在的价值观，因此，领航员要带着尊重和人性的温暖与观众直接互动，并对一人一故事剧场活动更大的社会和政治框架保持敏感。演员们也可以将与个人故事相关的社会和政治因素带入舞台行动中。通过聆听这些故事，我们可以感受并编织出我们作为一个社群的更大故事的深层网络，从而挖掘出集体和普遍的经验。社会变革和转型就从这里开始，我们通过个人的声音为社群的故事留出空间，并受到这些故事的影响。

**The Playback Actor -** Authenticity in the spontaneous moment underlies Playback Theatre practice. The notion of the 'citizen actor' is very much part of the Playback world - that everyone has the natural potential to perform Playback Theatre in a satisfying enough way. Nevertheless training and regular practice are essential for good work. Playback Theatre challenges the actors to listen, allow intuition and inspiration to arise, trust and support each other, and to call upon their innate personal wisdom and experience. So in Playback Theatre training, in addition to theatre skills, there is a requirement to develop greater personal and social awareness. Playback performers come from many different backgrounds - social workers, educators, administrators. Some are professional actors, many are creative artists, trainers and therapists.

**一人一故事剧场演员 -** 自发时刻的真实性是一人一故事剧场实践的基础。“公民演员”的概念在很大程度上是一人一故事世界的一部分——即人人都有足够令人满意的表演潜力。尽管如此，培训和定期练习对于出色的工作还是必不可少的。一人一故事剧场挑战演员的倾听、直觉和灵感的产生、相互信任和支持，以及调用与生俱来的个人智慧和经验。因此，在一人一故事剧场培训中，除了戏剧技能之外，还要求培养更强的个人和社会意识。一人一故事剧场表演者来自不同的背景——社会工作者、教育工作者、行政人员。有些是专业演员，很多是创意艺术家、培训师和治疗师。

**The Playback Company –** The norm is for a group to practice together regularly, perhaps one evening a week, for a period of time, before performing openly. Many groups continue to practice like this for many years and make a commitment to regular performances - monthly or bimonthly - for their community in a public venue. When a group becomes more skilful, they may do special commissions eg. birthdays, opening and closure of conferences, and so forth. It is an interesting phenomenon that members of Playback companies tend to stay in a company for many years often for little or no remuneration for their time or service. Somehow the values and work of Playback Theatre - the orientation of theatre in direct service to the community - gives more than sufficient reward to the members of a company. And the investment of shared experience over a period of time creates an artistry that can be truly extraordinary.

**一人一故事剧团 -** 通常情况下，一个团体在公开演出之前，会定期在一起练习，也许每周一个晚上，持续一段时间。许多团体多年来一直这样练习，并承诺每月或每两个月在公共场所为社群定期演出。当一个团体的技艺越来越娴熟时，他们可能会在生日、会议开幕式和闭幕式等场合进行特别演出。一个有趣的现象是，一人一故事剧团的成员往往在一个剧团工作多年，而他们的时间或服务却很少或没有报酬。不知何故，一人一故事剧团的价值观和工作——直接服务于社群的剧场定位——给剧团成员带来了绰绰有余的回报。长期的共同经验投入创造出了真正非凡的艺术性。

**The diversity of contexts and audiences -** The flexibility of the Playback form permits a high degree of sensitivity to the needs of specific groups. Here are a few examples…

**语境和观众的多样性 -** 一人一故事形式的灵活性满足了高度关注特定群体的需求。以下是几个例子......

- **Social change & action:** A group in the Northern Territories of Australia performed to Aboriginal communities as part of a programme to enhance self-esteem and recovery from substance abuse. Playback has been used in hearing from both sides on the Palestinian/Israeli issue. In Argentina, Playback helped reconstruct collective memory of their social/political history. In Kabul, stories that cannot be told in a court of law, have been told in a context for transitional justice.
- **社会变革与行动：**澳大利亚北部地区的一个团体在土著社群演出，作为增强自尊和从药物滥用中恢复的计划的一部分。在巴勒斯坦/以色列问题上，一人一故事被用于听取双方的意见。在阿根廷，一人一故事有助于重建其社会/政治历史的集体记忆。在喀布尔，在过渡时期司法的背景下，那些无法在法庭上讲述的故事得以被讲述出来。
- **Corporate contexts:** An audience of Swiss engineers and accountants shared stories through Playback Theatre about organisational re-structuring; an audience of Post Office workers in Washington DC were facing redundancy.
- —**企业语境：**瑞士工程师和会计师观众通过一人一故事剧场分享了关于组织重组的故事；华盛顿特区邮政局工人的观众面临裁员。
- **In education:** In Alaska, schoolchildren used Playback Theatre to deal with their grief over the death of a fellow student. Hong Kong teenagers perform playback as part of their community service programme. In a Washington DC school, Playback Theatre is part of the curriculum to teach Quaker values and the practice of inner listening.
- **教育方面：**在阿拉斯加，小学生们用一人一故事剧场来处理同学去世的悲痛。香港青少年将一人一故事表演作为其社群服务计划的一部分。在华盛顿特区的一所学校，一人一故事剧场成为课程的一部分，教授贵格会的价值观和倾听内心的实践。
- **In therapy:** Playback Theatre is also used as an additional tool for psychotherapists in their group work. In Chicago, a group of outpatients with schizophrenia met regularly to do Playback Theatre for each other, and told stories of coping with everyday life.
- **在治疗中：**一人一故事剧场也被用作心理治疗师在小组工作中的额外工具。在芝加哥，一组患有精神分裂症的门诊病人定期聚会，讲述应对日常生活的故事，互相演出一人一故事剧场。
- **Community events:** In Sydney, Playback Theatre was part of a wedding celebration. In London, it was performed in the basement of a Chinese restaurant on the topic of gambling addiction. In Japan, a Playback group performed for mentally handicapped people and their friends and family every month. In South Africa, it was performed to encourage awareness of HIV/Aids issues.
- **社群活动：**在悉尼，一人一故事剧场成为婚礼庆典的一部分。在伦敦，在一家中餐馆的地下室上演了以赌博成瘾为主题的一人一故事剧场。在日本，一个一人一故事剧团每月为智障人士及其亲友演出。在南非，为提高人们对艾滋病毒/艾滋病的认识而演出。
- **Public performances:** Playback Theatre is performed to the general public at theatres and art centres all over the world. It has been said that Playback is a theatre of neighbours. You may have come into the theatre as a stranger, but almost certainly by the end of the evening, you will feel a sense of aliveness and ease in talking to the people around you.
- **公开演出：**一人一故事剧场在世界各地的剧院和艺术中心面向大众演出。有人说，一人一故事剧场是社区邻里的剧场。你可能是以陌生人的身份走进剧场的，但几乎可以肯定的是，在晚会结束时，你会感到一种与周围的人交谈的亲切感和轻松感。

**Grounding the Transpersonal -** One could say that Playback Theatre is a form of healing theatre, which creates an opportunity for the divine to enter in to an experience shared by a gathering of people. However one conceives this, it is nevertheless grounded in everyday life & stories, where the spontaneous enactment of personal experience builds connection between people by honouring the dignity, drama and universality of their stories.


**立足于超越个人的 -**有人会说，一人一故事剧场是一种疗愈剧场形式，它创造了一种机会，让神性进入人们的共同经历。无论如何理解，它都是以日常生活和故事为基础的，在这里，个人经历的自发演绎通过尊重其故事的尊严、戏剧性和普遍性来建立人与人之间的联系。
