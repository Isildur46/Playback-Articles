# Abstract

In this two part article, we consider Playback Theater as a type of oral tradition. In the first part we focus on the formation of myths from personal stories during a playback performance. In the second part we conduct a comparative analysis between the concepts of Narrative Reticulation (Jonathan Fox) and the Functions of Mythology (Joseph Campbell). Our exploration is presented as a conversation, a dialogue between the two authors, about the benefits of developing mythological awareness among playback practitioners. This is how this text was born. Editing was undertaken, but hopefully some of our banter and self-irony, along with our more serious thoughts, are preserved. Many of the concepts we discuss have been tested in practice, in the most dramatic circumstances, against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We did not know that our ideas would be tested in this way. But it happened. We hope that this text will prompt your own understanding of Playback Theater and mythology. Enjoy your trip!

# Introduction – Theory and Practice

By the time you read this, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been going on for over a year. And the Ukrainian community of playbackers used and confirmed much of what was written in our article.  Several things helped us continue to use Playback in the conditions of a full-scale invasion:

- **Identity and history:** The shock of the first days was felt by the Ukrainian playbackers because of the loss of relations and support. Before the war, we were barely acquainted people with a common interest called Playback Theater. But since the beginning of the war, the community chat has become a powerful tool to support us. Stories about struggle, volunteering, refugees -became part of the community. It united us and made us closer to each other.
- **Serving others:** Our cosmogony, our Center of the World began to revolve around the idea that we, as playbackers, can be useful now. We played for people in bomb shelters, refugee shelters, for volunteers. And it wasn’t always a playback performance. Sometimes it was workshops, sometimes just songs, sometimes games.
- **The hero’s path:** It took place during our activities, and for the entire community. We heard the call, crossed the threshold, died and were reborn, and came back to life as others. This trip changed not only us, but also the spaces we were in contact with.
- **Allies and assistants:** As in many fairy tales and myths, when the hero has problems, aid comes from fairy-tale helpers. The world community of playbackers came to us. The Humanitarian foundation of the Ukrainian School of Playback Theater, which was filled by playbackers from all over the world, was an important material support for many Ukrainian playbackers. This support had an almost sacred meaning. It was important not only because of money, but as a sign that we are cared for and supported. And it gave hope and strength to move forward in the most difficult times of this war.
- **Online community projects:** The new space that opened in response to the COVID pandemic, was useful for us. Ukrainian Playbackers used ideas from the article below such as the *‘Supervision Club’*, which helped leaders take care of their teams. *‘One-and-a-half rooms’* concentrated on supporting Ukrainian Playbackers, and gave a voice to various professionals, expanding our communications, and allowing community figures to be heard. The *‘Story Collectors’*, is a project that documents the war stories of Ukrainian Playbackers. The idea of myth making enabled us to create supportive spaces online. You will find them all in this article.

# Part one. Let’s chat about myth

М – Marat Mairovich

R – Roman Kandibur

## Narrative of the narrative

R: Modern philosophical and scientific thought, postmodernism, for example, talk about narrative (storytelling) as the main manifestation of a person in the world. Everything else is a consequence of the storytelling. It turns out that even science is also narrative in nature.

M: Even the very approach to understanding reality and existence is by its nature narrative.

R: No matter what we do, we still tell stories. Even now, when I tell you this, it is also a story. And even our actions imply narrative. Imagine: a man is packing the pipe. He had done this action hundreds of times before. This is already a habit. But it is based on the story of how to smoke a pipe, which his grandfather told him, and all the stories about how a person first tried tobacco smoke.

M: In general, when we open our mouths, stories are born, even when we are in contemplation, we get a story.

R: Playback Theater is the only thing in modern society now that implies oral tradition. In fact, we refer back to the experience of humanity when all narratives were oral.

M: You’re right. Stories were oral for a reason. They were passed on so that the personal narrative becomes part of the collective experience. In Playback Theater it is there, as well as the transfer of individual and social experience. And they interact.

R: Yes. And it is impossible to convey with the help of a book. The oral tradition developed 70,000 years ago, and writing appeared about 5,000 years ago, during the agrarian revolution. Harari (2011) writes that the first writing was about how much and where grain was stored. It was not originally invented to convey stories.

M: Like Harari, you and I are now creating a story from this. If it is better to tell the narrative orally, rather than write it down, why are we writing all this?

R: Well, we write as if we were talking. We deceived everyone.

R: Then there is a question. We, the playbackers, are reviving the oral tradition, but at the same time, it turns out that we, like all the people, began to perceive stories indirectly, because we created another level of abstraction in the form of text, which formalizes and structures what is happening, as narrative structures our experience. This is no longer from person to person, but rather a person – a text -a person.

M: It seems to me that anyway there will be some adaptation of the narrative here. One adaptation is textual, the other is oral adaptation from generation to generation. In any case we are dealing with a narrative. Contemporary culture creates and conveys stories through text. And before, the adaptation of narratives was gradual, from generation to generation, through oral tradition. It makes me think about what Playback Theater is, and why it is suitable now.

R: Come on, come on!

M: Usually myths are created and adapted from generation to generation – in the oral tradition. We’re talking about mythology and the adaptation of narrative in contemporary art. Now everything in the world is shrinking and accelerating. And so, the adaptation of the narrative turns out to be the moment of ‘compressing’ the narrative on the stage. History, a segment of real life, is compressed and adapted to the necessary questions and answers of the modern world. And we, the playbackers, working with the stories, adapt them to the ‘Here and Now’ of our audience. We also ‘compress’ them because we reproduce them right there in place. Right? Maybe you see some other adaptation of the narrative? Has anything else changed since ancient times?

R: It seems to me that the character has changed. We are now living in the era of humanism. Right? Human rights, market economy, liberal democracy. One way or another, this is all clear to almost every homo sapiens on earth. Well, that’s what Harari says. In ancient times stories by the fire were told about gods, ancestors, animals, while man was just a small part of the big picture of the world. Now, the myth of the gods is not relevant. The myth about ourselves is more relevant to us.

M: Ok, I accept. Although if we are talking about Hellenism, then there are already undivine elements of the myth.

R: Yes. But Odysseus is a demigod. They are all a little bit not human … They are heroes! Well, this is a Greek epos.

M: I agree, gods influence events, but they are not about gods. Well, mostly about them.

R: Therefore, answering your question, Playback Theater is very relevant to the modern world. We rely on the ancient experience of myth-making, directing it to the modern humanistic narrative.

M: Well, yes, way to go! Accepted.

## The power of myth

M: I know that myths are divided into two types: the first is about the creation of the world (cosmogonic myth), and the second is about the awareness of the world.

R: Do I understand correctly that the first one is *“The world was created in 6 days, and on the 7th there was a party”*, and the second is about what?

M: The second type is about initiation, transformation and life cycle transitions. For example, a boy becomes a man.

R: And these myths unfold through Campbell’s functions: a description of the world, its laws and rules, the path of transformation and healing, a miracle (Campbell, 2004).

M: The power of myth is not only in ritual, but also in the size of the tribe connected to it. The myth is especially strong when many people are connected to it through the same ritual. For example, the Jewish holiday of Passover, when they read the Passover Haggadah (the story of the exodus of the Jews from Egypt – הגדה): the same text for many generations, they eat the same food, and sing the same songs. Even a person who does not believe in God quite often experiences sentimental feelings and a feeling of “*connectedness*” to his people, ancestors. The same can be found in all cultures: Christmas, Shivaratri, etc. But, on the other hand, if during the same Easter dinner, grandfather tells a story from his life, then (in my opinion) it will be less powerful than the story of the Exodus from Egypt.

R: It all depends on what you use to measure the amount of power.

M: In my opinion, the power of influence of a myth is the number of people affected by this myth and their ability to participate in the rituals associated with it. Strength for me depends on the people and generations connected to the myth and on the frequency of repetition of rituals.

R: And what if grandfather’s story influenced the life of his grandson so much that, even being told once, it completely organized his whole future life?

M: Then we have different measurement criteria. But both are relevant, especially for Playback Theater.

R: I think they are relevant for art in general. A shaman in an African tribe and a performer at the crossroads of Avenue Street in New York are doing the same thing – they revive the myth through ritual. Richard Schechner (2004) wrote about this in his fundamental work on performance studies.

M: Yes, they (shamans/performers) create the ritual space. And the story of the grandfather was told in the ritual space “*Seder Pesach*”, which is also the point of unification of the individual and social influence of the myth. Then the influence of such a platform as, for example, Zoom, can have a very large impact, as a space of mythology, because we can create great and powerful myths that are not controlled by geographical and cultural boundaries.

R: And in this sense, the strength of Playback Theater and myth, is very relevant. After all, we live in a time of postmodernism, when the main action is narrative and messages.

## Playback Theater as an act of myth-making

M: Personally, I have this need – to tell a story at a Playback Theater performance. Why? It seems to me that we have a dialogue in our life all the time: subconscious – conscious. In the process of telling a story, and in the process of watching how it is played back, the story is “*packaged*”, some subconscious things emerge.

R: Well, yes. We (playbackers) “*package*” the narrative into a specific form that allows us to understand the hidden meanings of the story. The same story can be packaged differently. And the meanings may be different.

M: Yes, different meanings. And sometimes people tell traumatic stories multiple times. They share them at the performances of different companies, at rehearsals, repeating and checking various types of “*packages*“. Just to let others play with the story like children play in the sandbox. They seem to say – this is my story, I feel bad with it, I cannot understand its meanings, because it hurts. And then, watching it come to life on the stage, he begins to realize some layers that he himself could not reach.

R: That is, it happens thanks to the packaging / shape?

M: Yes. If we work according to the laws of mythology, the packaging itself becomes transcendentally deep. Because a myth is a story that works for everyone, and it is something that can be passed on from generation to generation, its influence extends to the whole society. At the same time, the myth is always relevant at the individual level, it clings to personal layers, answers basic questions. What works here is that the form helps the content to manifest. The myth teaches us to “*correctly*” comprehend a personal story.

R: Yes, and here’s what I thought. In playback, we often literally play stories; we reproduce the text without creating aesthetics. And if we perceive a story as a myth, and generally think about it as a myth, then we will go into the depths of the story.

M: Yes, we will be freer, and we will see wider and deeper.

R: Remember, at the festival in Odessa you said that the story itself is not a myth, but the story told in Playback Theater is a myth? So, the very process of performance creates a myth.

M: Well, yes, like in Campbell’s approach.

R: Yes, in the book Pathways to Bliss (Campbell, 1949) he describes the four functions of myth: Cosmogony, Laws of Morality, Path of Transformation and Miracle. Playback fits all of these features. The story describes the space of action, the place of action, describes the laws and rules that live in this story, has a personal impact on the transformation (self-impact) of not only the storyteller, but also all those present. Stories told in the playback performance give rise to the red thread of this performance, and their connectedness gives the feeling of a miracle.

M: Campbell also says that today art carries out the function of creating and disseminating mythology. That is, modern shamans and priests are artists, actors and directors. And I believe that one of the main playback functions is myth-making. Playback works with personal stories, turning them into mythical ones, that is, stories that are relevant not only to one person, but to the entire community, so that others can find their own questions and answers related to this myth.

R: For example, a personal story about breaking up with a girl turns into a Lost Love myth. The story told in the space of the Playback Theater performance ritual is a myth. Oral tradition in the flesh.

M: Yes. And in this way, we, like our ancestors, transmit knowledge about this world.

## Miracle and story

M: It seems to me that a miracle happens when a story is told and suddenly it comes to life on stage.

R: Campbell says that in every myth there is this sense of magic, of a miracle. And our thesis is that any story told in Playback Theater becomes a myth. Let’s say the storyteller shares: *“I drank a delicious cup of coffee in the morning”* – there seems to be nothing magical about it. But in fact, there is. When we reproduce this story on stage – in a song, or a dance, or any other figurative form, then the effect of miraculousness will just appear.

M: Well, yes. Miracle in playback is the transformation of the mundane into the magical. Another element of myth-making is that many people are involved in its creation. Here the actors are the conductors of the magic, and the audience witnesses the miracle.

R: Spectators thereby become participants in the action. Not only for the storyteller does it become magic, but the miracle manifests itself for everyone, for the entire community.

M: Yeah. First, the appearance of the storyteller on the stage and the story itself. Then the transformation of the story into a myth. And perhaps the spontaneity and improvisation of the actors on stage is the condition for the appearance of a miracle?

R: Spontaneity is magic in Playback Theater. Why is spontaneity magic? Because a miracle in itself is a life in uncertainty, beyond logic, beyond cause-and-effect relationships. It’s when we feel some kind of connection between events A and B, however our logic, our apparatus of reason cannot draw this line, this line is only in the sensory sphere.

M: Yes! We are looking for connections. Not logical connections, but, as you said, precisely at the sensory level, at the level of experiences and impulses. Or maybe something that connects strangely, but doesn’t feel like a miracle? For me, a miracle is also fascination, the perception of the divine, a miracle is something that delights, terrifies, evokes strong feelings.

R: In life we can reduce the intensity of experiences. The instinct of self-preservation works in the head. The mind tries to maintain the familiar perception of the world. But on stage, playback enhances the experience. It comes to life and turns out to be a real magic. Viewers often say, *“How do you do this? This is really some kind of magic!”*

M: Exactly. The playbacker operates on a territory where everything is magical. This is the space of the collective unconscious.

R: The viewer does not see a logical connection; he does not understand how we do it. Accordingly, he has a sensory response, and magic happens for him. So, this IS magic.

## What the spectator sees on the stage

R: When the viewer listens to the storyteller, he has two processes. Rational and sensual. I identify with both the story and the storyteller. The viewer perceives stories from their identities: gender, age, occupation, etc. And the second is sensual, he empathizes, and can share these feelings. While listening to the story, the viewer creates an internal architecture, a building in his head called *“I understood the story”.*

M: And when an actor plays a story on stage, this building can collapse. Surprise!

R: Yes, surprise. We want to be surprised. Often, we hear from the teller: *“Oh, the performers saw something else in this story, something more that I didn’t pay attention to.”*

M: Good. And the second thing?

R: Second, there is the main element of the story, which must necessarily manifest itself on the stage. That is, in playback, the viewer simultaneously wants two opposite things from the actors: to be surprised and to be shown the essence of the story.

M: The viewer craves for Miracle/Spontaneity and …

R: Yes. The viewer has just heard the story, he understood something about it, but when the actors, for example, start singing it, this is ‘wow’ for the viewer. On the other hand, if the actors do not reproduce the essence of the story, the viewer will be disappointed. That is, the Ego of the hero changes, but at the same time the Soul remains unchanged.

M: Yes. Singing is aesthetics. And through aesthetics we can get to the Miracle.

R: Yes, the practical task of aesthetics is to destroy the circumstances, the plot. For example, the story is about an office worker who is trying to submit an accounting report, and the actors can play it through the myth about Don Quixote and his struggle with windmills. Such an aesthetic filter brings pleasure to the viewer, because it surprises. This, by the way, is the essence of humor. Humor is about an unexpected decision that is not in everyday perception.

M: By the way, the game is built on the same principle. Some rules of the game are created, which are broken at some point. This is often the essence of humor.

R: Yes. We want to go beyond the cognitive perception of the world. As you said, we want a Miracle. Thus, there are two parts in story: the holy, sacred part – this is the heart of story – and the everyday world. On the altar stage the actors sacrifice a routine and remake it, preserving the essence, and then return the same story, only now completely sacred. And it is at this point that story finally becomes tribal and turns into a myth.

M: I agree, the essence of the story is preserved. At the same time, at the intuitive/archetypal level, the actors create an element of miracle/spontaneity. And for a miracle to happen, you need to create a sacred space.

## Sacred geometry of a performance

R: Stories unfold in a specific space. And if it were a different space, there would be different stories. In Odessa, one performance in winter, a storm began, a blizzard, everything was covered with snow, and only three spectators came. At the same time, the actors thought that no one would come at all. And now this is already a big story – the circumstances, this blizzard and storm, united all the participants in the performance and influenced its atmosphere/cosmogony.

M: I agree. And here the squaring of the circle turns up. Campbell mentions this in *“The Hero with a Thousand Faces”* (Campbell, 1949). The squaring of the circle is a kind of symbol of the transition from earthly to heavenly. And this appeals to me with playback and with a myth. So, a holy place, for example, a church, a building in the form of a square, denoting the four cardinal points, and in the middle of this building there is a round altar. And this is the place where the hero meditates, realizes himself in the Universe, his destiny.

R: Then it turns out that the essence of the ritual is the unification of a square and a circle, Earth and Heaven. What is impossible to do in an ordinary state of consciousness, but only in a ritual trance.

M: Yes, and let’s think about the playback process through this sacred geometry. The performance of Playback Theater is a sacred event, and it should take place in a sacred space. That is, we are building some kind of temple for sacred rites. And this is important. Jonathan Fox is talking about this, albeit in a different language.

R: The simple phrase *“building up the stage” has* a deep meaning and requires a lot of attention. Because what we do every time is we erect a temple and an altar and consecrate them. Playback architects.

M: That’s right. So how does it work? The room in which we play is usually square, and people, playbackers and spectators, very often sit in an oval.

R: Where is our playback circle? I don’t always have people sitting in a semicircle. Usually, the seats for the spectators are parallel to the stage.

M: Well, we definitely have a circle when we close the space with the audience. On one side there is the storyteller, the conductor, then the actors sit in a semicircle, even if the rows are parallel rather than in a semicircle. (See Figure 1.)

**Figure 1. The Playback Theater performance circle**

R: And inside there is the emptiness of the stage, this is the altar, the center of the temple, to which we all go, where the hero’s meditation takes place.

M: Yes. The spectator comes to the temple, and when he becomes the storyteller, he puts the story on the altar-stage, and then the actors meditate on this story, turning it into a myth.

R: Very powerful. I want to return to this moment of preparing the space for the performance – building a temple. Our spaces, where we conduct performances, are square. This is the manifested world in which we perform a physical action – we set up chairs, set up lights, set up music.

M: Yes. And there is also a circle, our “*altar*”. And here the question is, how do we sanctify it?

R: In my theater, there is a ritual when, just before going on stage, we stand in a circle and count to 21 so that only one playbacker speaks aloud at a time. And if we screw it, then we start counting from the beginning. This is how we tune in and create the initial seed of holiness-trance, with which we consecrate the scene when we open the performance.

M: Yes. All the playback groups I’ve worked with have a similar ritual. One way or another, before the performance, all of them stand in a circle! But I do not agree that we ourselves consecrate the scene – the storyteller does this, telling us a story. When the playback ritual occurs.

M: For me, the sacred temple and the squaring of the circle happens during the performance. The temple and the altar are just a building and an object, and only ritual and action, and a properly prepared atmosphere gives a lot of immersion. But I agree that preparation itself can also be called sacred. Okay, can you divide the concepts into Consecration (preparation) and Sacred action (performance itself)?

R: In my practice, it is important for me to define the value of preparation, this is *“building the scene”,* since in my opinion, the quality of attention of the playbackers to preparation is super important. *“Good enough”* Playback Theater is when the actors build a temple and consecrate it with their efforts and attention, their inner ritual, and then open up the space for the entire tribe. And the square of the circle during the performance, the altar of the temple, is open not only to the priest-actors, but also to the storyteller …

M: Exactly. This reminds me of *“The Hero with a Thousand Faces”* (Campbell, 1949) the part where the hero finds himself in *“The Womb of the Whale.”* He is swallowed up by some kind of power, a certain Whale, a cave, a garbage compartment on a star ship. The same thing happens during a performance in Playback Theater. The storyteller, who is leading the ritual, moves from his usual environment, the audience, to the stage. He separates from the tribe, rises on the stage and is “absorbed” by it, that is, our altar/Whale; and then the Whale (the stage) spits him out, and he comes out different.

R: Yes, on stage, on the storyteller’s chair, like in the belly of a whale, a person finds himself isolated from ordinary society and everyday life. This is a very important experience. People have forgotten how to live in isolation, weightlessness, inactivity, peace. The myths that they have consumed in recent decades were about active doing. For example Batman, Superman, Cat woman, Frodo, Anna and Elsa. Playback Theater teaches us not only to be active, but also to be passive.

M: I agree! After all, Buddha actively studied with many famous teachers for a long time, but he never found enlightenment. And, just sitting under Bo’s tree, he isolated himself and said, *“until I reach enlightenment, I won’t get up from here.”* And here I have a strong connection with the story of Jonathan Fox and his isolation in Nepal.

## Sacred rules

R: Sacred rules are about the fact that the laws of morality and ethics came not from human relations, but from the divine. Moses received the tablets on Mount Sinai (Semitic myth), Vyasa wrote Mahabharata (Hindu myth), Odin taught people runes (Scandinavian myth). Relationships between people and morality are not a human invention, but divine laws that came from above.

M: Interesting. I haven’t thought about it yet. And does this have anything to do with Narrative Reticulation? (Fox, 2019)

R: Actually, the laws and regulations are the Ritual, which is voiced by the conductor. That is Guiding. The conductor talks about the playback rules: we raise our hand, we listen carefully to the story, we play it. The conductor, in this place, becomes some kind of actual conductor of the sacred rule. It was not people who came to the performance and agreed on the rules by which everything would happen. Someone came and said *‘this is how it goes’* from Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas; they are like the Prophets of the Supreme Being.

M: The Ritual plays the role of a moral code, which in our case was brought by Jonathan and Jo?

R: Well, they brought it from humanistic concepts that arise from Christian-Jewish morality. Plus, Jonathan’s reclusion in Nepal also falls on this idea.

M: Why is the Ritual important and what is its power?

R: The Ritual separates the individual profane (ordinary) space from the individual sacred (sacred). And similarly, the social profane – from the social sacred. But where is this border between social and individual myth?

M: And where, according to this border, is Playback Theater? For example, in the year of the pandemic, Jonathan started the Listening Hour (Fox, 2020) project (in the Russian-speaking environment you can find the name *“Circle of Stories”),* and he just listens to stories. Is this enough for a myth?

R: Listening Hour has its own ritual. There is a Guide, there are rules that organize the storytelling, and there is a creative act of the Guide at the end, when he collects all the stories (red thread) – called a *“reprise”.* Perhaps the very act of telling and listening creates the atmosphere and flow of the stories, thereby creating a myth.

M: Does the therapist create mythology in an individual session? How are we playbackers different from a psychotherapist? After all, it seems to us that it is precisely and especially playback that creates the myth in which the entire tribe is healed.

R: Psychotherapy also works with myths. After all, there is an idea in society about who psychotherapists are. It is with this view that the client comes into the session. As one of the representatives of this profession, I know that within a session there is even a shamanic experience, just like in playback.

M: The question is not in the idea of psychotherapy, but in what happens inside the process. And this is an individual experience. It reminds me of individual myths about how a child goes through his initialization and turns into an adult. Always, at the beginning and, especially, at the end, there is a connection to the tribe.

R: Well then, psychotherapy is a myth about isolation, where a transformation takes place in a small closed sacred space, after which the Hero returns to the world. And in playback …

M: … A social myth is created in which the entire tribe is involved, and in which there is a connection to both individual and universal human experience.

R: Yes. Playback Theater is in the middle, between big social myths and individual myths, this is our strength, the Power of Myth and Ritual!!!

## Ritual, cyclicity, game

M: If we say that myth is ritual, then one of its properties is repetitiveness and cyclicity. In this case, the improvisation itself can be of ritual character. That is, cyclical. We can come up with structures on the fly, creating some rules with which you can work on stage.

R: Improvisation is ritualized. We have a bunch of rules. Always say *“yes”.* Tuning in… and so on.

M: I mean how we play on stage. For example, a game is a rule/structure that appears right here and now. The actor begins to act somehow, and there are two options for the reaction of his partners. They either support, following this rule, or they act exactly the opposite.

R: That is, the Game, as a structure created during the game, is born on the altar/stage, and thus becomes a ritual. For me, what you say about repeatability is very important. Myths and rituals are characterized by repetition, this is an integral part of the tradition. No matter how many times we play a wedding, the ritual will be the same. Different people, different places, but the wedding is the same. For Pesach, for instance, twelve courses and so on.

M: No-no-no, I understand where you are taking me. You say that for all myths there is a form of ritual, and I say that within the myth there are elements of Game. For example, the famous tale about Tsar Saltan: he turned into a fly, flew, bit, returned. Then he turned into a mosquito. All the time he turns into something and bites. This is the element of constant repetition.

R: And so it happens in many tales and legends. For example, Cinderella has three tasks. And by the way, in J. Campbell’s monomyth (Campbell, Moyers & Flowers, 1988) – this happens before the battle with the dragon, here is such a cyclical nature.

M: Before, during and after.

R: And usually there are unbearable tasks that cannot be completed. This is not possible in everyday reality. But in a fairy tale (myth), the hero copes with this, relying on magical abilities. This creation of something on the stage, happens through some repetitive actions. These patterns carry energy, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the aesthetics brought by the actor. Perhaps this aesthetics is not in the story itself. But thanks to the combination of this repetition, support and so on, we can build some Cosmogony on the stage, some architectural work. The architecture is invisible, but it is present, and everyone is witnessing this building.

M: Plus. The structure is architectural in nature. We can, by word or action, create structure through cyclical, repetitive, and ritualistic. Just like architects and builders build a building floor by floor.

R: Then it turns out that at some point we need to destroy this building.

M: Yes. Break the Game, that is, change the already established rules. But, breaking Game, you do not ignore it, you base on it. Look, if this is a structure, then you can look at it as a kind of shell, a prison that holds the hero until he can break it and thereby change his world. And the fact that we are spinning in a circle in life, it is cyclical, as we cannot get out of it. The Wheel of Samsara. And to get out of it, we, as a Hero, must die, but we die in this action. We die and are reborn as others. We change ourself with the help of heaven. Perhaps our earthly cycle and circle limits us. We thereby reach a new level of ourselves, opening up new opportunities.

R: Yes. And here we are helped by the laws that Joseph Campbell formulated for us in “*The Four Functions of Myth*” (Campbell, 2004) and Jonathan Fox in “*Narrative Reticulation*.” (Fox, 2019) This connection will help us to consciously approach the sacred architecture that we build in game and Playback Theater in general.

## Afterword to Part 1

R: The story that is told and played back in Playback Theater becomes a myth.

M: To comprehend a story from the point of view of a myth is to dive deep. We connect not only to a specific story/storyteller/audience, but also to a common human experience.

R: Playbackers prepare the space for the performance – they build a temple and an altar, connecting the square and the circle, the Earth and the Sky.

M: Myths are cyclical, like the existence itself. Then game is a microcosm that repeats the macrocosm of life.

R: Playbackers are conductors of sacred rules. We teach these laws to spectators.

M: Miracles occur in our life all the time, but it is the temple / stage that allows us to realize / feel them in full.

R: Dear reader, that was the first part of our journey. Shall we go ahead?

# Part 2. Playback through the myth-making prism

## Junction points between Functions of a Myth and Narrative Reticulation

R: I’m interested in understanding the general mechanism of Campbell’s myth and making a comparative analysis with Fox’s Narrative Reticulation.

M: Narrative reticulation. Why do we need this theory, if in practice we are already doing everything that it says? I understand that Fox means that we should improve the quality of our actions through awareness. And he creates a theory that helps to structure experience and look at the world through this prism. We may be doing the same with myth-making. That is, if we know the Functions of Myth (FM) and Narrative Reticulation (NR), then there can be direct practical benefits from a comparative analysis of these theories. And through this analysis, we can improve the quality of our creativity. Right?

R: I agree, and it is important that in the moment of theorizing, our thoughts about the Functions of Myth and the theory of Narrative Reticulation intersect and mutually complement each other. For me, this is like confirmation of both theories.

M: I agree. It seems to me that in this way the theory of NR receives an anthropological theoretical foundation. After all, when a theory meets other scientific theories (argues or agrees, elaborates on them), it becomes more grounded.

R: Let’s put everything in a table.

M: Sure. So, we present to your attention a table of concepts from NR and FM. Here, it is only important to say that we do not quote the authors, but voice our own understanding, and we bring attention to the articles and books in the bibliography for a more complete study of all aspects of these theories.

M: Let’s do it stage by stage, let’s talk about the Atmosphere and Cosmogony. For me, the Atmosphere is something primary. Of course, it will change in the process too, but its main function is manifested before the beginning, and what we, as performers, can influence, can actually create. Performance is based on a foundation; this is cosmogony. What was done *“Before.”*

R: Yes. And the important moment of the Atmosphere and Cosmogony is time. As a category of everything existent, as the points of beginning and end.

M: So, what can be done before the *“manifestation of the world”?* We can prepare space, light. And here I want to remind you about squaring the circle.

R: Yes. After all, the temple is a model or reflection of the universe. The space of performance in essence reflects all those stories and states which we can bring into it. That is why it is worth looking at the space-time of the performance through the eyes of a demiurge architect.

M: How the ends of the world are connected the dome of heaven. So, the awareness of the atmosphere/cosmogony should be all encompassing. Like the myth, it is worth creating a sense of transition through all our chakras (from the base/animal to the sublime divine/heavenly).

R: Therefore, we need to realize, legalize and use the elements of space-time. For example, where is the entrance to the performance space, or how the light falls, or how to put chairs for the audience, or how to send a Zoom meeting link to the spectators. All this is sacred geometry, the walls of our temple.

M: Great. Now let’s talk about Guiding/Laws of Morality.

R: I have a feeling that both Guiding and the Laws of Morality are the glue that prevents this circus from falling apart. These are the principles of structure formation.

M: I agree. Guiding has to be ethical and fair. The main figure of the guiding is the conductor. And he brings in moral rules and goodness. He rounds the ends of the audience/community to the center, that is, he takes care of everyone. He dictates the rules of ethical and empathic treatment of storytellers and opinions of different parts of the audience/society.

R: And then who is a conductor through the prism of Joseph Campbell’s Functions of Mythology?

M: God! United and fair!! And also, a Guide giving the right advice (from the point of view of the Path of the Hero).

R: I completely agree with the Guide, but not with God.

R: Let’s agree that the Conductor is the Prophet.

M: Well, okay. After all, the Prophet, he is a part of God, His voice (the Voice of God).

R: Still, what is the practical application of Guiding/Morality?

M: Not to forget about the outcast. God loves everyone, and therefore everyone should be heard. It cannot be otherwise, else a community will not be created.

R: Thanks to laws/rituals, we do not question our innocence or legitimacy every time. Here’s a metaphor: we take on the *“burden of the commandments”* of the playbacker, entering a special performative state of service. The perception of Guiding at the level of feelings *“makes the river flow, the banks direct the water, and the river does not turn into a swamp.”* Therefore, it is not only about knowing the rules and rituals and telling the audience about them, but also about taking them as a vow, as a spiritual practice, and feeling them.

M: Yes, well said!!

R: Oh my, and yet what can we say about Story and Way of, God forbid, Transformations?

M: What do you want Roma, it’s the same thing, well, almost. In essence, in both there is a certain chronology, certain pattern of their unfolding.

R: And this is wonderful, I especially like what you said about chronology, it seems to me that this is the very practical side of the correspondence between story and transformation. Will you repeat?

M: The story has its own laws, and they cannot be violated, even if the narration is not linear, it is still logical.

R: And you can realize this with your mind, but more often with your own intuition. The playbacker learns to feel the hidden tempo-rhythm in history, to find the Heart of History – its true essence.

M: Yes. The story consists of ‘cubes-events’. The way the cubes are arranged, the transitions from one cube to another, and their overall totality is Story. Platform-Essence-Epilogue or Start-Mid-End. This logic of arranging cubes-events is exactly what guides us in the process of the story and builds the structure.

R: If we look at the logic of the change of events, the speed of their alternation (tempo-rhythm/chronotope), their intensity, then thanks to all the above we will be able to see the Heart of the Story. But, since there are often a lot of data, this is not even about *“seeing”,* but rather it’s about *“feeling”.* The heart of the Story opens rather through intuition.

M: Okay, now Miracle! And Spontaneity.

R: It turns out that Miracle is a kind of clarity or aesthetics that manifests itself from an ocean of possibilities. Thus, by adjusting the quality of contact between all participants in the performance, we create an ‘altar’ on which the hidden is manifested.

M: And the miracle is that it is impossible to cognize it with consciousness. Impossible to structure.

R: Yes, this is a kind of sensory experience that passes through our bodies and minds and is embodied on the stage. That is, the magic is not in the uncertainty itself, but in the fact that we combine our material nature (body, voice, consciousness) with the energy that came from the *“Flow” (Csikszentmihályi, 1990).*

M: Well, good. So, we’re done discussing the table. Important note. All these elements are not absolutely related and identical. They seem to be talking to each other. And sometimes they can be combined in a different way. For example, Jonathan Fox’s Story may well intertwine with Campbell’s Path of Transformation, as we suggested in the article, but also with Campbell’s Miracle.

I suggest finalizing this part. The most important practical application of our concept is healing. Campbell writes that by restoring the flow of symbols (myth), we connect the conscious and unconscious that are in a narrative dialogue, which is actually an integrity.

M: Yes! And it’s wonderful.

R: This is the conciliatory power of the Playback Theatre

M: And the myth.

R: And then it turns out that this stream of symbols is suspiciously like the Red Thread, what do you think?

M: YES! And also to the Path of the Hero.

| Narrative Reticulation/Function of Mythology | Short description of Narrative Reticulation | Short description of Functions of a Myth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atmosphere/ Cosmogony | **Atmosphere** M: This is what surrounds the performance in the physical space (weather, buildings, interior) and in the cultural space (information environment and mentality) “here and now”.R: And also, this is the time of the performance (time of day, day of the week, season of the year, holidays or special dates). It affects both spectators and actors. | **Cosmogony** R: This is the manifested world and its structure, the myth of the appearance and destruction of this world. Past-Present-Future.M: The place of a person in the Oikumene, the structure of the world. The logic of the emergence of “I”.R: The level of pure energies, primary elements. Primary ambivalences such as Chaos-Order, Fate-Chance, Good-Evil, Heaven-Earth. |
| Guiding/ Moral laws and regulations | **Guiding** R: For me, this is primarily a Ritual and the distribution of power and responsibility.M: I wouldn’t say power, it’s rather control! And first of all, conscious control.R: Guiding is landmarks that guide us towards a certain state (tribal rallying, healing, “every story counts”). | **The laws of morality and ethics** M: How to organize chaos and protect yourself by helping the tribe.R: The essence of the laws between people – laid in heaven (“tablets of the covenant“)M: social distribution: King / merchant / commoner.R: The sacredness of the social structure. |
| Story/ Personal transformation path | **Story** R: Narrative, verbalized experience. Story is a logical sequence of events.M: Story is like nested dolls / Matryoshka, it can be multi-level.R: It covers both personal stories of and the story of a place, community, state, humanity.M: In playback it is the Red Thread and four levels of a story. | **Personal transformation path** R: This is a sequence of initiations that help a person come into the world, from a child to come of age, then become an adult, accept old age, and prepare for the Dark Gate.M: The cycle of life of nature (spring-summer-autumn-winter) and that of a person.R: It is the death and resurrection of the Ego, the balance between spirit and personality.M: and between the senses and the mind…R: That is, body and mind.M: In general, all that we can express with the phrase the Path of a Hero |
| Spontaneity /Miracle | **Spontaneity** M: It is Here and Now, connecting to the senses, reacting to the atmosphere, story and guiding.R: Connectedness. Existential dialogue between I and You, impulses that are born from contact. It is also about the actions of the actors, about the “birth” of stories in the audience and about the spontaneous interventions of the conductor.M: Creativity. | **Miracle** M: An unknown event that evokes admiration.R: I would even say that blows your mind. Living in a territory of uncertainty.M: Divine, Unconscious event – Discontinuity. R: Connection with all that exists, extra-linguistic experience.M: Indescribable, noradrenaline and endorphin (shake, but do not stir). God peeps out from behind a cloud. |

**A comparison between elements of Narrative Reticulation and Functions of Myth**

## Path of a Storyteller

R: The performance is the integral Path of the Hero. The storyteller/hero hears the call, he answers it and raises his hand to tell the story. The conductor comes to him as an assistant and invites him to cross the threshold. And then the storyteller crosses the Threshold, the stage boundary. What’s going on next? Death. For the transformation to take place, he must die. How does he die? He disappears because as a person he ceases to exist in the focus of attention of the playback ritual: on the stage he is embodied by the actor.

M: AKIR? Don’t be greedy, tell the whole world about your term.

R: AKIR is the abbreviation we use at the Ukrainian School of Playback Theater. The initial letters for the Russian phrase for *“Актер Который Играет Рассказчика”* *(“The Actor Who Plays the Storyteller”)* – AKIR.

M: Good term. Everyone who has read it – use it!

R: Let’s continue. The storyteller disappears/dies, and his counterpart, AKIR, lives on the stage.

M: It is a process of transformation. Death and rebirth. This is how the myth manifests itself.

R: Yes, and the criterion of the Path of the Hero is that the journey changes not only the hero himself, but the whole world around him. Campbell talks about it.

M: Awesome. Our hero’s path and mythology are intertwined. Because the myth changes all the people in the audience, since they are either witnesses or participants in the creation of this myth. That is, we have a process in which all are involved. Some are more active; some are less active.

R: And all spectators can equally be heroes.

M: Yes, and of course there are spectators who choose not to tell the story. They are thrashed or they simply did not join the performance process, and they are not ready to hear the Call and become a Hero. In this case, they become secondary characters of this myth-making. Witnesses.

R: There is also a projection mechanism. If the spectator has not told the story, then they can identify with the storyteller. Many people experience this feeling: *“What to tell, what to tell?”* And then someone comes out and tells. And then in his head: *“Oh, this is my story!”*

M: Well, yes, being a hero is not easy. It’s like a princess who threw away the frog’s skin. That is, the path that the spectator would also like to go, but he was afraid and did not let himself go there.

R: Well, here’s a question to the conductor. To what extent was he a quality assistant and guide through the Threshold?

M: Perhaps the question is not only for the conductor, the question for the spectator, is he ready to become a hero at this stage of his life? And then the question is, who do we have then as the Dragon for the storyteller?

R: It seems to me that the audience itself is the Dragon. The judgement of the audience.

M: Cool, yes.

R: Go out and tell something in front of this whole audience, it’s scary. And it turns out that the eyes of all these people, their attention – this is the Challenge, the Dragon, the fight against it. It is located inside the head of the storyteller. That is, it is clear that no one beats up the storyteller. This is the inner fear of evaluation, the fear of rejection. What he copes with when he goes on stage.

M: This is an inner and outer critic. Our life processes can be stalled by criticism. The storyteller does not physically fight for his place on stage. If he had to go through the audience, physically making his way … I don’t know, it’s my logic that works this way.

R: Well here … Well, what is the Dragon doing?

M: Guardian of treasures.

R: Yes. The dragon checks whether the hero is worthy or not. This is one of the checks. It he is going to cope or not. Well, it seems to me that this whole process, the need to get up and go out, is a check and a test.

M: It seems to me that leaving the audience is not a Dragon after all. The whole process of the emergence of the storyteller is the Path of the Hero:

- First, the conductor acts as an external Call – *“Who has a story?”*
- The spectator raises his hand in response to the Call.
- He goes to the Path, passing through the audience, rejecting himself from the usual life, crossing the Threshold, and finding himself in the distant kingdom – on the stage.
- The conductor turns into an assistant-sage.

R: Exactly! Then I realized who the Dragon is!  The hero-storyteller fights with the Dragon – a chthonic creature – with his emotions and images of the past, critic, chaos of the unconscious, turning it into a structure. Feelings, events and images become a narrative, a story.

M: And then when his story is played on stage, two things happen:

- The symbolic death of the hero – he disappears from the focus of attention – everyone is looking at the stage.
- The acquisition of the Elixir – sacred knowledge that transforms both the storyteller and the entire tribe (audience). That is, thanks to the actors’ play, the storyteller gains a new vision of his story.

R: Yes. And then the Hero returns home with the Elixir, i.e.:

- The storyteller becomes part of the audience/tribe again.

M: This is the Path of the Hero, which the storyteller goes through.

R: And this is only one part of the process, because the Hero is not only the storyteller himself, but also all the participants in the performance.

M: Yes, because the whole audience seems to delegate the storyteller to come out, because he is a representative of the audience.

R: For example, the Red Thread phenomenon is a story told by an entire tribe. This means the Path of the Hero, which we walked together during the performance, and our common myth that was born in the process.

(A story made up of all the stories told in the performance. The Red Thread appears during the performance. It can be linear and follow the Aristotelian arch. It can be interrupted. One of the reasons for the creation of NR is an attempt to answer the question of why the Red Thread appears. There can be several Red Threads, depending on who is looking at the performance and how.

An example from the performance by *“Neighbors”* Playback Theatre, when the stories were like this:

1) To share your inspiration

2) To go on vacation to Zanzibar and hear the roar while walking in the jungle. It was … a scooter.

3) To be constantly on the move. Losing a home and rebuilding everything again. And so on in a circle. *“Lord, why!?”*

4) To get angry with an emotional employee, and then be in her place.

5) To say goodbye to a good job for your dream job.

In my opinion, the Path of the Hero is clear in this performance. He goes the path of transformation, hearing the Call and sharing his inspiration with the world, but finds himself in a dark forest, where he is frightened, and the charm disappears. Then he loses everything he has. Death and Rebirth: The Hero gets angry and turns into his Shadow. And the Hero realizes his destiny, and he has enough strength to go his own way.)

M: Yes! This is a good interpretation. And then there is the very theme of the performance, chosen and announced by the team. And also, how the actors reveal this topic through personal stories in the introduction and the conductor through Guiding.

R: And what happens to the Playback Theater company in the process of company life is also, in a sense, the Path of the Hero and transformation.

M: Yes, you are right, and for every participant in this performance who brought something from home with him.

R: I agree. It’s hard to believe that I’m saying this, but in my opinion, it’s time for us to summarize.

M: Well, let’s finish it?

## Mythological awareness of a playbacker

R: I become alive when the myth unfolds among the participants in the performance, in this space, with these stories, when I say *“Yes”* to the reality that happens here and now. There is a new energy, a new perception of the world, connections within the community become more significant and valuable.

M: Good. But what if for you, just like for me, playback is already an old and very familiar story?

R: Yes, and this is a big trap for us playbackers. Because it’s not an old story. Here’s an example. Not so long ago I came to teach Playback Theater at the festival of spiritual practices in Lithuania. I came as, you know, such a cool and well-known coach, I just gave a training in Odessa. And I hit reality hard with all my narcissistic face. A huge festival with a zillion people, but only one person comes to my master class.

M: Wow! Why?

R: Because I acted from my old experience, from the fact that I know everything and can do everything.

M: Is it somehow connected?

R: It is. Because when I started to throw away my masks and look at what is really happening here, I was able to develop a different narrative, a different text, with the help of which I began to invite people to my master class: so that they would come. That is, I have combined the global Playback Theater myth and the local history of the festival. And it all worked when both myths (I-Playback-Theater and I-festival) were in consensus.

M: To quote Campbell: *“Yes, myths offer models of life, but models must be acceptable for the time in which you live and for that place. And our time is measured by the speed, so what was acceptable fifty years ago is unacceptable today. What was previously considered a virtue has now become a vice. And much of what was previously considered a vice has now become a need … As a result, we have what is called a mechanically imposed mystical experience*“. (Campbell, Moyers & Flowers, 1988)

Possibly, Roma, you brought with you a mechanical mystical experience from the previous training. Right?

R: Exactly.

M: Now listen to what good old Campbell says. *“The old tradition can be preserved only under one condition, if it is updated in accordance with the circumstances that have arisen.”* (Campbell, Moyers & Flowers, 1988)

R: That is, in our case, Playback Theater is busy updating old myths. Well, adapting them to modern realities?

M: Yes. At the same time, nothing really changes. Campbell says: *“The basic motives of the myth are the same. They were always the same. If you want to find your own mythology, then first of all you have to decide which society you belong to. Any mythology arises in a certain society in a limited space. Then mythologies collide, relationships are established between them, they merge, and as a result, a more complex mythology is formed ”*. And as a special treat he adds: *“There is a mythology that connects you with nature and the natural world, of which you are a part, and there is a purely sociological mythology that connects you with a certain society. You are not just a living person, but also a member of a certain group … Usually a socially oriented system is inherent in nomads who moved from place to place, the purpose of which is to determine the place of each person in this group. And nature-oriented mythology is the prerogative of farmers.”* (Campbell, Moyers & Flowers,1988) Here. That’s it.

R: Cool, Campbell knows everything about me.

M: And therefore, it is important to connect and be aware of local and global myths.

R: Mythological awareness.

M: Yes. And if you answer the question why it is needed, then here is my answer. Mythological awareness not only helps to create a pleasant Atmosphere for spectators and actors, we also create a whole world – Cosmogony. If this is remembered, then we will be focused on the Squaring of the Circle, on the sacralization of the room and the immersion of people who will perform sacred rites in it.

We will not only be Spontaneous, which is very beneficial for health and soul. We will seek the Miracle, both for ourselves and for the others.

We not only work with Stories, but we also walk the Path of Transformation together with all the participants in the performance.

We not only use Guiding to better construct a performance, we adopt the Law and Code of Ethics as a kind of code of conduct. Just like people who received tablets (runes, scrolls, knots) from God.

R: You just formulated the playbacker’s myth-making manifesto! Cool!

# KaMa conclusions

So, we got to the conclusions. From this moment we decide to merge into a single voice (Kandibur + Mairovich = KaMa (Hindu deity of love)

We hope that everything that has been said before will inspire you to walk our path. And when you step on this path, it will become your own, because the world is great, and the world of myths is even larger, and the thread of Ariadne is in the heart of each of us. So you won’t be able to repeat it, but, perhaps, some of our tips will help you if you do playback or learn myths.

The most important thing is the towel; without it, the hitchhiker has nothing to do in the galaxy. But seriously, here are our major milestones/guide stones:

- **Myth-making** is the gateway to the creative flow. When you begin to comprehend Playback Theater and the stories told in it through this prism, you will be able to connect to the common human experience (at least we succeeded). And it is immensely deep. Therefore, your vision of stories will become deeper and wider.
- **The Squaring of the Circle** – in myth-making, the playback space is the temple, and the stage is the altar. Here stories are told and played, and thus myths are born. You can realize this through physical space – a square building, a round stage, but this also applies to the construction of any playback space. This realization will help you and your company (as we believe) prepare the temple and altar. The smoother the circle, the deeper the atmosphere and synergy within.
- **Ritual** – the founders ****of playback also speak about ritual. And it acquires a new and important meaning if you look at it through myth-making. After all, our entire past is permeated with ritual, and it is not just a procedure for actions. Form gives meaning to everything.
- **Game** – myths, ballads and fairy tales are cyclical, just like existence itself is cyclical. They are cyclical at both the macro and micro levels. If you use Game as an element of improvisation on stage, it will create a platform for stories to come to life.
- **Narrative Reticulation and the Functions of Mythology** – For the two of us, one of the most important discoveries in this conversation is the phenomenological similarity between Fox’s Narrative Reticulation Theory and Campbell’s Functions of Mythology. Firstly, it’s fun (both laugh), and secondly, it gives Playback Theater substantiation on a human level and helps a deeper understanding of its aspects.
- **The Path of the Hero** – we all go through the path of transformation, caused by our choice or circumstances. All participants in the performance pass the Monomyth individually and all together as one tribe. If we remember this, then we will be able to comprehend each ritual action as a stage of the Hero’s Path.
- **Healing and Teaching the Community** — The act of service is at the very center of playbacker’s moral code. Therefore, entering the stage, the playbacker turns, as it were, into a clergyman (shaman, priest, druid), continuing the oral tradition of mankind. And just like our colleagues from the distant past, we bring the Myth to life to heal and unite the community. Our service is especially needed where there is pain, be it a natural disaster, war, or the struggle of minorities for their rights. Our service unfolds in all places where in response to the question *“Who has a story?”* someone will raise their hand…
