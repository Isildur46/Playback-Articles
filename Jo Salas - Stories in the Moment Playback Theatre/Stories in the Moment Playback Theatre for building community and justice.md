**Anthology Vol. 2: Chapter 4 Summary**

# Stories in the Moment: Playback Theatre for building community and justice

# 当下的故事：营造社区和正义的一人一故事剧场

**By Jo Salas**

In this chapter Salas, one of the co‐founders of Playback Theatre, focuses on two major case studies of peacebuilding performance: addressing school bullying in the United States, and working with victims of war in Afghanistan. Drawing on audience members’ personal stories, Playback Theatre creates performances which facilitate social change based on dialogue, connection and empathy. Salas describes both workshop and performance formats: In a workshop setting, a trained leader engages members of a group in telling stories and acting them out for each other. In workshop settings, most audience members are familiar with each other and enact stories in ways that have meaning both for the teller and other group members. In contrast, performance settings have a defined audience and a team of performers, including actors, a conductor, and musicians. The dialogue that occurs in both styles of Playback is an embodied, imaginative dialogue which often results in *kinesthetic* conviction that the teller of the story has been understood. The deep sense that one’s story has been heard often creates an increased openness to other points of view, an expansiveness which may accommodate others’ humanity.

在本章中，一人一故事剧场（Playback Theatre）的联合创始人萨拉斯重点介绍了建设和平表演的两个主要案例研究：在美国解决校园霸凌问题，以及与阿富汗战争受害者合作。一人一故事剧场以观众的个人故事为基础，通过对话、联系和共鸣来促进社会变革。萨拉斯介绍了工作坊和表演两种形式：在工作坊中，训练有素的领导者会让小组成员讲述故事，并相互表演。在工作坊中，大多数听众彼此熟悉，讲述故事的方式对讲述者和其他小组成员都有意义。相比之下，演出场合则有明确的观众和表演团队，包括演员、领航员和乐师。在这两种一人一故事剧场的方式中进行的对话都是一种具身的、富有想象力的对话，其结果往往是*亲身感受*故事讲述者已被理解的信念。深刻感受到自己的故事已被倾听，往往会对其他观点持更加开放的态度，这种开放性可以容纳他人的人性。

## PARTICIPANT PERFORMANCE AND SCHOOL BULLYING

## 参与式演出与校园霸凌

Salas describes the role of Playback Theatre in addressing the growing violence evidenced through bullying in schools in the United States. Salas and her ensemble have developed the program “No More Bullying!” (NMB), which works alongside other anti‐bullying programs. Through NMB, Playback Theatre engages personal stories, emotions, and embodiment in ways that fostering empathy and enhance capacities for treating others fairly. Children are invited to speak about their experiences as victims, witnesses, or bullies, then watch as their feelings and stories are enacted in front of them.

萨拉斯介绍了一人一故事剧场在解决美国校园霸凌日益严重的暴力问题中的作用。萨拉斯和她的剧团发展了"不再霸凌！"（NMB）项目。该项目与其他反霸凌项目并行不悖。通过 "NMB"，一人一故事剧场以培养同理心和提高公平对待他人的能力的方式，将个人故事、情感和具身性融入其中。孩子们被邀请讲述他们作为受害者、目击者或霸凌者的经历，然后观看他们的感受和故事在他们面前演绎出来。

These performances take place in a carefully designed atmosphere of respect in which children feel empowered to speak up. This safe space is based on several elements: the consistent modelling of respect on the part of the adults; the immediate addressing of disrespect; and the welcoming, nonjudgmental embrace of students’ narratives, including those who are marginalized or isolated.

这些表演都是在精心营造的尊重氛围中进行的，在这种氛围中，孩子们感到自己有能力说出自己的想法。这种安全空间基于以下几个要素：成人始终以身作则，尊重他人；立即处理不尊重他人的行为；欢迎并不带偏见地接受学生的讲述，包括那些被边缘化或孤立的学生的讲述。

With a preference for using the participant performance model, the NMB Leadership program, meets once a week for 7‐8 weeks, during which students learn the basics of Playback and deepen their understanding of bullying. Salas finds that having students’ peers onstage increases the impact of anti‐bullying messages and strategies, as young people are often more willing to listen to their peers than to respond to lectures from adults. The power of these young people’s performances are based in part in their authenticity and their familiarity with the audience members’ frame of reference, resulting in enhanced capacities to prevent and deal with bullying.

NMB 领导力项目偏向于使用让参与者来表演模式，每周一次，持续 7-8 周，在此期间，学生们学习一人一故事剧场的基础知识，加深对霸凌的理解。萨拉斯发现，让学生的同龄人站在舞台上会增强反霸凌信息和策略的影响力，因为年轻人往往更愿意倾听同龄人的意见，而不是回应成年人的说教。这些年轻人的表演之所以有力量，部分原因在于他们的真实性以及他们熟悉观众的参照系，从而提高了预防和处理霸凌问题的能力。

## PARTICIPANT PERFORMANCE IN AFGHANISTAN

## 阿富汗的参与式演出

In this section, Salas highlights Hjalmar Jorge Joffre‐Eichhorn’s work with Playback Theatre in Afghanistan, a context where current and historical trauma are constantly present. In this setting, Playback Theatre’s impact has been both constructive and at times problematic as it strives to effect some measures of transitional justice. Initially, Joffre‐Eichhorn trained 24 men and 6 women in Playback Theatre and other approaches to peacebuilding performance, both through a week long workshop and “on the job training” in 16 performances. Audiences for these performances included victims’ and widows’ groups, children, and the hearing impaired. Later on a number of participants took part in a workshop facilitated by Karin Bettina Gisler, the founder and director of Zurich Playback Theatre. This training was again followed by multiple performances.

在本节中，萨拉斯重点介绍了希亚尔马尔-豪尔赫-约弗尔-艾希霍恩在阿富汗的一人一故事剧场工作。在阿富汗，当前和历史创伤一直存在。在这种情况下，一人一故事剧场的影响既有建设性，有时也很棘手，因为它努力实现一些过渡时期司法。最初，Joffre-Eichhorn 通过为期一周的工作坊和 16 场演出的"以演代练"，对 24 名男性和 6 名女性进行了关于一人一故事剧场和其他建设和平表演方法的培训。这些演出的观众包括受害者和寡妇团体、儿童和听障人士。随后，一些参与者参加了由苏黎世一人一故事剧团创始人兼导演 Karin Bettina Gisler 带领的工作坊。这次培训结束后又进行了多场演出。

In early 2009 some of these participants created the Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organization (AHRDO), providing opportunities for Afghan men and women to explore human rights, democracy, and transitional justice. Their intent was to build contact and cooperation among victim’s groups, strengthening their ability to speak with a united voice when working with policy makers. Throughout 2009 and 2010, AHRDO carried out more than 50 performances, mostly in Kabul, but also in other parts of Afghanistan. Many audience members embraced these opportunities to speak about their experiences, describing appalling hardships, losses, abuses, and injustices. Most of the audience members were people of low social standing, many of them women, whose opportunities to share their narratives had been marginalized by dominant power structures and official accounts. Through the responses of other audience members, people learned that their experiences were shared by others, thus mitigating the isolation often suffered by victims of violence. Although telling stories in these settings provided victims of torture and trauma ways to reconnect with their full humanity, at times sharing these narratives was painful.

2009 年初，其中一些参与者创建了阿富汗人权与民主组织 (AHRDO)，为阿富汗男性和女性提供探讨人权、民主和过渡时期司法的机会。他们的目的是在受害者团体之间建立联系与合作，加强他们在与政策制定者合作时发出一致声音的能力。在整个 2009 年和 2010 年期间，阿富汗人权捍卫者组织举办了 50 多场演出，其中大部分在喀布尔，但也有在阿富汗其他地区的演出。许多观众利用这些机会讲述了他们的经历，描述了骇人听闻的艰辛、失去、虐待和不公正。大多数听众都是社会地位低下的人，其中许多是妇女，她们分享自己经历的机会被主流权力结构和官方说法边缘化了。通过其他观众的回应，人们了解到其他人也分享了他们的经历，从而减轻了暴力受害者经常遭受的孤立。尽管在这些环境中讲述故事为酷刑和创伤受害者提供了重新认识完整人性的途径，但有时分享这些故事本身也是痛苦的。

Salas contends that in contexts such as Afghanistan it is crucial to have “citizen actors” who emerge from the same population as their intended audience and who are trained especially to enact their stories. She points out that it is hard to imagine performers who did not share the audience members’ background being able to effectively enact these stories, or to imagine entrusting such sensitive stories to outsiders.

萨拉斯认为，在阿富汗这样的环境中，至关重要的是要有"公民演员"，他们与目标受众来自同一人群，并接受过专门的培训来讲述他们的故事。她指出，很难想象与观众背景不同的演员能够有效地演绎这些故事，也很难想象人们将如此敏感的故事委托给外人。

Playback Theatre honors audience members’ narratives, trusting that the sequence of stories within an event will yield a collective story that has meaning for those present ‐ It does not attempt to establish an objective account of the past. However, given the many intertwined histories in Afghanistan, renditions of the past are at times contradictory. Because of the potential contentiousness of this aspect of Playback narratives, the AHRDO ensemble has decided to work with more homogeneous groups before attempting to bring together people whose historical understandings are widely divergent.

一人一故事剧场尊重观众的叙事，相信剧场中的故事序列将产生一个对在场者有意义的集体故事——它并不试图建立对过去的客观描述。然而，由于阿富汗有许多交织在一起的历史，对过去的描述有时会相互矛盾。由于一人一故事剧场叙事在这方面可能会引起争议，阿富汗人权和发展办事处的小组决定在尝试将对历史的理解大相径庭的人们聚集在一起之前，先与同质化程度更高的群体合作。

There have been other challenges to implementing Playback Theatre in this context. Salas explains that there have been situations in which performers were not sufficiently equipped to address the stories of deep trauma which were elicited. She goes on to outline some basic rules which create resilience and safe spaces for performing stories of traumatic experiences: Stories that are potentially traumatic for the teller should not be enacted literally. Instead, performers may maintain a safe distance by depicting horrific events with minimal gestures and narration, or by suggesting the events offstage. The conductor might also instruct the actors to use a shortened form rather than enact a story more fully, or more experienced actors might be called on to take these roles. Another safety measure is for the conductor of a performance to sit physically close enough to monitor how the teller is responding as she tells and watches her story. Another is for performers to develop the capacity to work with objective detachment in the face of someone else’s anguish, especially if it might resonate with their own.

在这种情况下实践一人一故事剧场还面临其他挑战。萨拉斯解释说，在有些情况下，表演者没有足够的能力来处理所引出的深层创伤故事。她接着概述了一些基本规则，这些规则为表演创伤经历的故事创造了复原力和安全空间： 对于讲述者可能造成创伤的故事，不应按字面意思表演。相反，表演者可以保持安全距离，用最少的示意动作和叙述来描述恐怖事件，或在台下暗示事件。领航员也可以指示演员使用简短的形式，而不是更完整地演绎故事，或者请更有经验的演员来扮演这些角色。另一项安全措施是，表演的领航员者应坐在足够近的位置，以观察讲述者在讲述和观看故事时的反应。另一项安全措施是，表演者在面对他人的痛苦时，尤其是在可能与自己的痛苦产生共鸣的情况下，要培养客观超脱的工作能力。

Salas maintains that with adequately prepared actors and a highly skilled conductor Playback Theatre can provide a safe space for traumatic memories to be transformed into public testimony, in part by implementing ethical standards regarding respect, authenticity, inclusiveness, and avoidance of manipulation.

萨拉斯认为，只要演员准备充分，领航员技巧娴熟，一人一故事剧场就能提供一个安全的空间，将创伤记忆转化为公开的证言，部分原因在于贯彻了有关尊重、真实性、包容性和不操纵的道德标准。

Salas’ chapter demonstrates the ways in which Playback Theatre has provided opportunities to many women and men, victims of the brutal wars in Afghanistan, to find insight, meaning and dignity in their stories, to affirm connections with other victims, to release feelings of pain and anger and to comprehend the humanity of those whose experiences or backgrounds are different. As evidenced in these case studies, Playback Theatre demonstrates potential for transforming conflict in settings of direct and structural violence. Through performing audience members’ stories, these groups of people have created collective narratives that embody deeper understandings, new connections, and hope for more just, inclusive, and less violent societies.

萨拉斯在本章中展示了一人一故事剧场如何为许多阿富汗残酷战争的男女受害者提供机会，让他们在自己的故事中找到洞察、意义和尊严，肯定与其他受害者的联系，释放痛苦和愤怒的情绪，理解那些经历或背景不同的人的人性。从这些案例研究中可以看出，在直接暴力和结构性暴力的环境中，一人一故事剧场展示了改变冲突的潜力。通过表演观众的故事，这些群体创造了集体叙事，拥抱了更深刻的理解、新的联系，以及对更公正、更包容、更少暴力的社会的希望。
